E46/4 Sedan
The E46 is the successor to the E36 and is the next evolution in the 3 series development.
The E46/4 Sedan was introduced as a 1999 model as both the 323i and 328i.

The E46 3 series vehicle offers more comfort, safety, space and equipment than the previous E36, without compromising the sporty characteristics of the 3 series vehicle.
Since start of production,two engine variants have been offered, the M52TU and the M54
six cylinders. Both engines introduced changes and design improvements that will be covered in the Engine and Engine Management chapters.

E46/2 Coupe
The E46/2 Coupe was introduced as a 2000 model year vehicle in both 323Ci and 328Ci
variants.

The body of the E46 /2 Coupe is not a modified sedan, but is a completely distinct body.
There are no sheet metal parts shared between the Sedan and the Coupe Only the design
technology of the E46/4 was used to create the E46 Coupe. The Coupe is even longer and
wider than the sedan.
The E46 Coupes have been given the “Ci” (coupe injected) trunk badge designation. This
is a departure from the “is” (injected sport) from previous 3 series coupes.
Since start of production,two engine variants have been offered, the M52TU and the M54
six cylinders. Both engines introduced changes and design improvements that will be covered in the Engine and Engine Management chapters.

Body
Body Shell
The structural rigidity of the E46 body shell was increased using computer aided design
(CAD) techniques. Every component of the new body structure was designed using this
method. CAD allows the design to be translated into computer aided manufacturing (CAM)
more efficiently. To reduce the weight of the vehicle, while retaining strength, high strength
steels are used and now amount to 50% of the body shell weight.

The second area of focus of the body shell is "structural dynamics". This deals with vibration frequencies that effect the ride quality and rigid feel. The E46 body shell was designed
so that the frequencies for torsional twisting and bending are separated and are in an
inaudible range. The ranges match the E39 for twisting at 29 hertz and bending at 26 hertz.
The E46 continues with BMW’s safety cage concept for passenger protection. The tubular
impact structures continue to provide protection against body damage during front or rear
impacts.
The E46 is 1.8 times more able to absorb energy in a 40mph offset frontal crash than the
E36.

E46 Models

Hood and Headlights
The E46 follows the E38/E39 design with the kidney grille being integrated into the hood.
The grille openings are more rounded and sweep down to the front bumper. The cowl
opening is now integrated in the hood and is similar to the E38. The hood can be opened
to a maximum of 90°, the workshop position, by disconnecting the gas struts and inserting a pin in the aligned holes.
The hood is opened by first pulling the release lever located inside the vehicle and then
releasing the secondary catch that pops out of the grille.

The E46 carries on with the traditional four head lamp configuration, however, no internal
lens is used over each lamp. The free-form reflectors are clearly visible through the smooth,
plastic covers. The plastic covers are lighter in weight and more resistant to breakage than
the previous glass covers.
Vertical and horizontal adjustments for the head lamps are located on the upper rear edge
of the assemblies.
Xenon low beam head lamps will be an available option starting with 9/98 production.
Xenon headlights are discussed in the E46 Driver Information Chapter.

E46 Models

Doors
The doors on the E46 feature the door anchoring system introduced with the E38. The
anchor consists of a horizontal bar in the door and a hook at the rear edge. The hook rests
in a recess in the "B" and "C" pillars and it reinforces the body in the event of a side impact.
The door seal design is copied from the E39 and is a single piece seal.

10
E46 Models

Door Anchoring System
Cross section of driver’s door and
“B” pillar in the normal closed position.

Upon severe impact, the hook
locks into the recessed notch to
provide a unitized side impact protection system.

After impact, the door springs
back and unhooks the notch.
The door is clear of the “B” pillar
and can be opened.

11
E46 Models

Door Handles
The door handles and locking system on the E46 are of a new design. The new bow type
handles allow the doors to be opened easier. The locks are fully encapsulated including the
electrical components. The new door handle/latch/lock assembly offers improved reliability
and security against theft. The micro-switches for door position and lock condition have
been replaced by hall sensors.
There are no serviceable components on the lock assembly and it must be replaced as a
unit.

From September 2000 production, there was a modification done to the door handles of
the E46. The modified door handles when pulled, fold upward instead of straight out as
previous. The lock assembly was also modified to accommodate the new articulation of
the door handles.

12
E46 Models

Sunroof
The sunroof design is similar to the E38/E39, however, the sunroof cassette is not serviceable and must be replaced as a complete unit. The sunroof is an option on the E46 and will
come with a glass panel (moon roof) instead of a steel panel.

13
E46 Models

Interior Features
The interior of the E46 has been completely redesigned with an emphasis on more space,
luxury and convenience without compromising the 3 series sporty characteristics.
The new instrument panel/dash is similar in design to the E39 with a slightly less pronounced orientation to the driver. The E38/E39 type face vent grills are used for air distribution.
The multi-function steering wheel is available on both the 323/325 models and standard
on 328/330 models. There are two different steering wheels available, the four spoke wheel
with MFL and a three spoke sport wheel with MFL. The three spoke sport wheel is optional for sedans and standard in coupes. The MFL includes the controls for the audio system
on the left and the cruise control on the right.

The E46 comes equipped with a manually adjustable (tilt/telescopic) steering column. There
is 30 mm of vertical and horizontal adjustment for the steering column.

E46 Models

Seats
The front seats are similar in design to the E36 seats with new internal construction to
improve their support and comfort. Memory for the drivers seat position is available. The
seat controls, including memory storage buttons are located on the side of the seat base.
An optional lumbar support is also available for the E46.

16
E46 Models

A split folding (40/60) seat is available as an option on sedans and standard on coupe
models.
The release for the folding seat backs is located in the trunk on the left and right sides near
the wheel arches. This increases the security aspect when keeping items locked in the
trunk.

17
E46 Models

Power Distribution
The battery is installed in the trunk of the E46 and features lead/calcium plate material for
true maintenance free operation. The water usage of this battery is low throughout its service life.
The Battery Safety Terminal is installed at the positive terminal of the battery. A repair kit is
available for the BST.
The E46 is produced with a vehicle specific wiring harness. This harness is based on the
ordered optional equipment of the vehicle so that it contains the proper connectors and
connections. Options can not be added at a later time without replacing the entire harness.
Specific kits are available to repair the harness in the event of an accident or damage to the
harness. These repair kits include:
• Engine compartment
• Vehicle’s rear area
If the entire harness need to be replaced, a new harness with the maximum equipment or
options must be ordered. This is the only harness that will be stocked in the parts system.

18
E46 Models

There are three locations for fuses on the E46:
• The fuse holder above the glove box
• The E-Box in the engine compartment
• In the trunk near the battery
The E46 uses high amperage fuses for circuit protection. The battery power supply is protected by a 250 amp fuse in the trunk.

19
E46 Models

Front Suspension
The single ball joint, strut axle of the E46 is based on the E36 design. Design and component changes were developed to improve the ride quality and handling characteristics. The
following changes are incorporated into the E46 front suspension system:

• A new forged aluminum control arm is used on the E46 (except all-wheel drive). It offers
the advantages of weight reduction and lower unsprung mass.
• Hydraulic bushings are used for the rear lower control arm support.
• Hollow strut piston rods are used to reduce weight
• The steering knuckles are press fit into the strut tubes which reduces the tolerances of
the front suspension geometry.
• The caster has been increased to improve straight line stability.
• The track has been widened for improved cornering.
• Aluminum brake dust shields are used for weight reduction
Altogether there is 5.72 lbs less unsprung weight in the front suspension which enhances
ride comfort and handling.

20
E46 Models

Front Camber Adjustment
The top of the strut is mounted through elongated holes. The strut is fixed in position when
the vehicle is assembled. If minor corrections need to be made to the front end alignment,
the pin can be driven down and the strut can be moved in the slots to adjust the camber.
Approximately .5o of adjustment is available by moving the strut in the slots.

Follow the instructions for
making the Camber adjustment described in Repair
Manual 32 00 610.
Use Special Tool 32 3 140
to make the adjustment.

21
E46 Models

Rear Suspension
The design of the E46 rear suspension is based on the E36 "C" arm type. However, all
components of the suspension are new and designed to suit the E46 for:
• Comfort and convenience
• Handling and stability
• Noise reduction
The sub frame is a new design employing steel tubes and metal sections. It is more rigid
than the previous sub frame. This provides a stable platform for the rear suspension to
work from. The differential is mounted to the sub frame using a hydraulic mount. The sub
frame is mounted to the body at four vibration absorbing rubber mounts.
The upper transverse control arms are made from cast aluminum for weight saving.

22
E46 Models

Final Drive
The final drive is the compact (HAG
188K) type that is lighter in weight
than the type used on the E36.
Features of the compact final drive
assembly include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Compact housing
Shorter pinion shaft
Hollow drive flange shafts
No side bearing covers
Elimination of speedometer gear
Lifetime synthetic oil

Limited slip differential is no longer possible with the compact differential.
The drive shaft and differential are now mounted on the center line of the vehicle. This
enables the transmission tunnel to be narrower increasing the interior passenger space.
With this change, the axle shafts are now different in length and are no longer interchangeable.

Brake System
The braking system is upgraded for the E46 to match the vehicle’s size and braking requirements. The dual circuit (front/back) distribution system continues to be used for optimized
braking response and performance. Refinements to the brake pedal linkage increase the
brake response time to improve braking performance.
Single piston floating calipers with vented rotors are
used on the front and rear brakes.

The E46 uses a 10" vacuum booster, vented in the engine compartment to reduce noise in
the passenger compartment.

Body Shell
The body shell of the E46iC has been developed specifically for the convertible to improve
crash performance which is similar to the E46 Coupe. This was achieved by the use of
reinforcements on the body shell that improved torsional rigidity (body twisting). In the main
body floor pan, reinforcements were necessary to accommodate the new SGS (Seat
Integrated Belt System) seat system. In the rear floor pan, reinforcements were necessary
to account for the variable convertible top storage. compartment floor.

ART-E46BODY3

Components

Floor Pan
The floor pan is reinforced to support the SGS seat by heavier cross brace members, reinforced tunnel/floor pan and reinforced engine support brackets. During a collision all forces
occurring on the seat are channeled to be absorbed by the floor pan.

Windshield Frame
The windshield frame is reinforced with stepped
reinforcing tubes to allow it to act as a roll-over protection. During the rollover all of the forces exerted
on the A-pillar of the windshield frame are transmitted as a Moment (Torque) to the bottom of the Apillar where stepped reinforced tubes are reinforced.

ART-E46BODY4

40
E46 Models

Rear Bulkheads
The rear bulkheads are redesigned to support the rollover protection and seat belts. They are welded to
increase structural rigidity and to secure rear seat, rear
seat belts and the mounting point for the ISO child seat.

ART-E46BODY5

Variable Top Storage Compartment
The variable top storage compartment is reinforced to make the top storage compartment
rigid and stronger, not to allow twisting moments when the soft top is in its compartment
or when the compartment is opened to enlarge the storage area.

Tension Strut
Tension struts are integrated into the rear of the
body shell to improve the torsional rigidity by not
allowing body twist in the rear. It also keeps the
rear end of the car intact with the middle floor
pan.

41E46STRUT0100

Aluminum Support Plate
An aluminum support plate is incorporated into
the front suspension carrier to achieve a high
degree of rigidity combined with low weight.

All of these design improvements increased the
E46iC torsional rigidity by 50% compared to the
E36iC:

41E46PLATE0200

• E36 Convertible Torsional Rigidity 6000Nm/degree
• E46 Convertible Torsional Rigidity 9000 Nm/degree

41
E46 Models

REAR SEATS
The E46iC is designed as a four passenger vehicle. Only two seat belts are installed in the
rear that correspond to the seat belt system of the E36iC.

The E46iC is equipped with child seat mounting brackets on the left and right sides below
the seat base. The brackets conform to ISO (International Organization of Standardization)
for placement on the rear floor pan. Any ISO child seat can be installed by simply sliding
the seat into position between the seat base and backrest and locking it into place.

VARIABLE CONVERTIBLE TOP STORAGE COMPARTMENT FLOOR
Purpose of the System:
The trunk of the E46 convertible offers a new feature called the “Variable Convertible Top
Storage Compartment Floor”. This feature allows the luggage storage area to be enlarged
by approximately 40 liters when the soft top is raised or removed for hard top installation.

Components of the system:
Variable Compartment Floor
The variable compartment floor is constructed of plastic with fabric covering. It is hinged
mechanically so that it can be rotated up into the top storage area providing additional luggage storage space in the trunk. The floor is hinged at four points to allow it to articulate
and fold upwards:

43
E46 Models

Actuating Lever
An actuating lever is integrated in the variable compartment floor on the right side. It allows the compartment floor to be opened and closed using the
actuating lever. It also locks the compartment floor
into position.

Dampening Piston

A dampening piston is also integrated in the
variable compartment floor on the right side.
It assists in the movement of the variable
compartment floor to either position and keep
it fixed in that set position (retracted or
extended). The lower dampening piston
hinge switches the micro switch integrated
on the right side of the compartment floor
when the variable compartment floor is in the
raised position. This signal is provided to the
CVM to lock out the operation of the convertible-top.

DAMPENING
PISTON

MICRO-SWITCH

System Operation:
Opening the variable compartment floor
• The convertible top must be raised or removed from the storage compartment.
• Pull the actuating lever rear wards and push it down and toward the rear bulkhead.
Closing the variable compartment floor
• Pull the actuating lever down.
• Pull the compartment floor rear wards to close the floor.

time all-wheel drive will be an option (SA 203), available on E46 sedans and Sport Wagons
beginning 2001M.Y.
Vehicles with the all-wheel drive option have been given the engineering designation of
E46/16.
One of the significant changes from the previous E30 ix is that the E46/16 does not use a
viscous coupling or limited slip differential. The all-wheel drive system has largely been
taken from the X5 concept. It uses two open differentials and a single speed transfer case.
Power distribution is 38% to the front and 62% to the rear, giving the E46/16 the feel of a
genuine rear-drive road car.
With it’s additional 17mm ground clearance, the xi is particularly suited to stretches of snow
and ice covered roads and its sure footedness is made possible by the use of the Bosch
DSC III 5.7 system, first used on the X5.
Performance of the all-wheel drive E46 does not suffer either, this is because of a lightweight all-wheel drive system that only adds 100kg (220lbs). Weight distribution is largely
unaffected at 52.7% front and 47.3% rear (2wd: 51.0% front, 49.0% rear).

Chassis
Front Axle
The front axle has been completely re-designed over the standard drive E46. All
components are constructed of steel.
The front axle carrier consists of two
square frame sections welded to two
tubes to form a box structure. The
axle carrier is bolted to the vehicle
frame at both the front and rear
attachment points.

Front

The pivot at the apex of the lower
control arms are a separate ball joint
bolted to the axle carrier.
The purpose of the re-design of the
lower control arms and mounting
points is to provide clearance for the
front axle shafts.

The steel lower control arms, which
are smaller than the aluminum arms
used on the 2wd model attach at the
rear to the axle carrier.

Ball Joint

Lower Control Arm

The hydraulic engine mounts are
different from the 2wd version and
have also been relocated to provide
front axle clearance.
The front sway bar has been increased in diameter to 23.5mm (2wd standard: 23mm,
sports suspension: 24mm) to accommodate the additional weight. A sports suspension
option is not available for the xi.

E46 Models

The struts are shorter than the 2wd and there are reinforcement plates between the strut
bearing and the sheet metal of the strut towers to prevent deformation when traveling on
very poor road surfaces.

The spring travel of the E46/16 is
approximately 20mm less than
the 2wd version.
The shorter front axle spring
travel is due to the limited angle
of deflection of the front axle
shafts.

Steering
The rack and pinion steering unit
has been modified from the 2wd.
It is constructed with a
larger diameter piston.
This is necessary to counter the
additional drag of the all-wheel
drive system and the wider
standard wheels and tires.
The lower steering spindle is
different than the 2wd and
connects to the steering rack via
a double cardan joint.
Turning radius of the E46/16 is
35.8ft, 1.4ft greater than the
2wd.

Differential and Front Axles
The differential for the front axle is bolted to left side of the engine oil pan. The differential
is driven by a 40mm single piece drive
shaft. The drive shaft has universal Right Side Support Housing
joints at both ends.

The oil sump has been modified to accommodate the right side axle. A connecting tube is
welded into the oil pan. A shaft runs inside of the connecting tube between the front
differential and the axle shaft on the right side.

Two drive shafts of equal length are used to
transmit power to the front wheels.

The steering knuckle is modified to
accept the CV joint of the front axles.
The front wheel bearings are unique
to the E46/16 and incorporate the
wheel speed sensor pulse wheel into
the bearing seal.

The rear spring/strut travel of the E46/16 is approximately 17mm less than the 2wd version.
The reason for the reduced travel in the rear is to oppose any excessive body roll as a result
of the higher body profile.
The rear sway bar has been increased in diameter to 20mm (2wd standard: 18mm, sports
suspension: 19mm) to accommodate the additional weight.

Tires and wheels
Standard wheel size is 17x 7.0 to ensure there is enough room for the front axles and

Transmissions
There are two transmission variants for the 325xi and 330xi.

The manual transmission for both versions is
the S5D-280Z direct gear transmission. The
extension housing is modified to accept the
transfer case.
The transmission has a lifetime fill of MTF-LT1
synthetic transmission fluid.

S5D-280Z

The automatic transmission for both the 330xi
and 325xi is the A5S-390 R (General Motors)
transmission with GS 20 AGS control and
Steptronic shifter.
The transmission has a lifetime fill of Texaco
8072B.
A5S-390R

Transmission Cross-member
Along with the lower transfer case section, the
cast aluminum transmission cross-member is a
low profile design to optomize ground clearance.
Both manual and automatic transmissions
utilize the same part.

Transfer Case
The Transfer case for the E46/16 is the NV 124 manufactured by New Venture. The
primary difference between the NV 124 and the NV 125 used in the X5 SAV is that it uses
gears instead of a drive chain for torque transfer to the front axle.
The reason gears are used is to produce a
compact low profile transfer case that could
fit in the transmission tunnel of an E46 without excessively limiting the forward travel of
the drivers seat.

The transfer case is only one speed and
does not use any viscous coupler.
The transmission ratio of the planetary gear
set provides a fixed torque transfer of 38:62
(front:Rear). The output speeds to the front
and rear axle are the same (1:1).

The input to the Planetary
Carrier is from the output shaft
of the transmission.
The Sun Gear of the Planetary
assembly is turned by the
Planetary Gears, the Sungear
then provides torque to the
Transfer Gear.

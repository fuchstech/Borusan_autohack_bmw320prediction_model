The New 7 Series for 2009
Introduction of the F01/F02

In the late fall of 2008, the F01 will be in production in the Dingolfing plant. At the same time, the F02 (long-wheelbase version) will start
coming off the assembly line.
For the US market, the 750i and 750Li will be offered with the already known N63 engine. The F01/F02 is lower in height than the
E65/E66 and it has an improved rear passenger compartment area (space for head/knees). The overall wheelbase has been increased
as well. The headroom and luggage-compartment capacity are more or less the same as in the E65.

F01

F02

The F01 represents the 5th generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship sedan. In addition to being the pinnacle of luxury, the new 7 series
also combines the new engine and chassis systems to deliver class leading performance. With the already proven N63 engine, the F01
is more than capable of delivering on the promise of “Efficient Dynamics” which encompasses performance as well as the best possible
fuel efficiency.
As in the past, the 7 Series is packed with the latest innovations in driver information and assistance systems. Some of these optional
innovations include ACC Stop and Go, Night Vision 2, Lane Departure Warning, Active Blind Spot Detection as well as rear view and
side view camera systems.
To complement the many new developments on the 7 Series, there is also a new rear wheel steering system which is part of the new
“Integral Active Steering System”. This is the first time such a system has been installed on a BMW sedan. This system as well as
many other innovations and developments will be covered during the progression of this training course.

Powertrain

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Changes to Powertrain

For the US market, the F01/02 will be introduced with the familiar
N63 engine. For the most part, the engine is identical to the
version introduced on the E71.
Mechanically, there are no changes to the engine. The primary
differences exist in the form of ancillary components which are
vehicle specific such as the exhaust, air intake ducting, cooling
system, oil sump and engine electrical system.
The overview of the F01 powertrain includes the following:

• The engine management (DME) is now connected to the
FlexRay bus in addition to the PT-CAN.

• The ECM (DME) is now water cooled via the cooling circuit
for the charge air coolers.

• The fuel tank has been modified with additional breather
valves as well as additional measures to reduce evaporative
emissions.

• The low pressure fuel supply method is now a “pressure
controlled” design which eliminates the pressure regulator in
the fuel tank.

• The GA6HP26TU automatic transmission is carried over
from the E70/71 with the dual damper torque converter.

• The rear differential is now made from aluminum for weight
reduction. It has been optimized for low-friction operation.

• The driveshaft now uses the “push-fit” connection from the
E70. For the first time, this is now a flexible connection.

• The rear axle shaft now have a “push-fit” connection at both
ends. The F01 uses a solid axle shaft.

Engine Electrical System

The ECM (DME) is located to the front of the right-side spring strut
dome. The ECM is now water cooled via a circuit which is adapted
from the charge air cooling circuit.

Engine Control Unit
In the F01/F02, the N63 engine is controlled by the MSD85 as is
the case in the E71. This control unit has been modified to make it
compatible with the FlexRay used in the F01/F02.

The lower section of the electronics box is open to the outside.
The upper section, which contains the connections, has a
water-tight seal.

System Bleeding
When servicing the ECM or any cooling system components
within the charge air cooling circuit, the system must be bled
of any trapped air.

In order to do this, the system is bled much the same way as
vehicles with the N54 engine. See the “Workshop Exercise Cooling System” in this workbook.

Nevertheless, there are a few differences:

The only obvious difference is that no auxiliary coolant radiator is
used in the F01/F02. This is made possible by the use of highperformance coolant radiators. These also have a more compact
height, which is essential when it comes to pedestrian safety.

As usual, the coolant radiator has an integrated low-temperature
section for transmission cooling.

Thanks to the on-demand control of the electric fan, the characteristic map thermostat and the electric auxiliary coolant pump, the
thermal management system yields benefits in terms of fuel economy, comfort and power output.

The entire cooling module and the engine oil radiator and its lines
are decoupled from the body in order to optimize sound characteristics in the passenger compartment.

Charge Air Cooling
As it did in the E71, the turbocharged N63 engine operates with
an indirect form of charge air cooling. Heat from the charge air is
transferred to the coolant, then the hot coolant radiates heat into
the ambient air.

Coolant Pump

The coolant pump for the charge air cooling system is connected
to the ECM (DME) via the LIN bus.

There is a dedicated coolant circuit for this function. In the
F01/F02, the cooling for the DME is also integrated into this
coolant circuit. For the first time at BMW, the engine control
unit is liquid-cooled.

Fuel System F01/F02

The fuel system on the F01/02 has gone under some design
changes as compared to previous models. The familiar fuel tank
with divided chambers is still in use. The familiar configuration
which features the fuel pump on the right (passenger) side is also
retained.
Fuel Supply System
In order to comply with the regulations regarding evaporative
emissions, there have been several changes to internal fuel tank
components as well as the fuel tank itself.
The fuel supply system has also been modified to eliminate the
fuel pressure regulator. The following text summarizes the
changes to the fuel supply system:
• the fuel supply system is now “pressure controlled”.

• the fuel pressure regulator has been replaced by the
“pressure limiting valve” (8).

• the pressure in the fuel supply system is limited to a maximum
of 5.8 bar by the pressure limiting valve (8).

• the EKPS will control the fuel pump in order to deliver only
the amount of fuel required based on information from the
fuel pressure sensor (low pressure).

Pressure Limiting Valve

The pressure limiting valve is connected to ground by the plug-in
contacts on the service cover. This prevents electrostatic charge
on the valve.

The pressure limiting valve keeps fuel pressures in the feed section
lower than approximately 5.8 bar in the N63 engines
This prevents excess pressures from building up in the feed line.
Excess pressures would otherwise occur if the fuel filter were to
become blocked, which would place the feed section of the fuel
system under unnecessarily heavy loads.

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Fuel Tank Breather System
The increased demands on the evaporative emission systems
require continuous development and improvements. The F01/F02
is no different. One of the first things to notice on the fuel tank is
that there is only one service port. Also, the tank is made from two
pieces and joined by a plastic “welding” process.
The only items which are serviceable at this time are the fuel
pump, fuel filter and pressure limiting valve. There are several
breather valves installed to help the fuel tank “breathe” during
refueling and during operation.

These valves are therefore divided into filler valves and service
breather valves. The service breather valves have a smaller
opening, which means that, during refueling, they alone would not
be able to let air escape from the fuel tank fast enough.

There are service breather valves with and without over fueling
protection. The service breather valves are arranged in such a way
that air can still be released even if the vehicle is parked up on one
side.

The filler breather valve is located at a high position. If the fuel level
rises to this height during refueling, the valve closes. Air can no
longer escape from the fuel tank fast enough, which causes fuel to
rise up the filler pipe and switch off the fuel nozzle.

To enable the release of air to continue, there is a service breather
valve located at the highest point. However, the presence of the
valve in this location means that the fuel tank could be overfilled in
the event of persistent refueling.

Consequently, fuel would enter the activated charcoal filter and
ultimately flow back out of the opening. To prevent this, the highest
service breather valve is equipped with over fueling protection like
the one on the left-hand side of the vehicle (as a safeguard if the
vehicle were parked up on one side). Fuel that is carried along with
the release of air is collected in a fuel trap and pumped back into
the surge chamber.

Automatic Transmission

The F01/F02 is available exclusively with an automatic transmission. The transmission is the GA6HP26TU that was introduced
with the E70 and was subsequently fitted in many model series
since.

The F01/F02 features the already familiar electronic gearshift
carried over from the E7X and E6X vehicles. The GWS is mounted
on the center console which differs from the previous column
mounted shifter on the E65.

Gear Selector Switch
The gear selector switch on the F01/F02 has been carried over
from the E6x and E7x. In both automatic and manual mode, operation of the switch is monostable. In other words, the selector lever
always returns to its original position.

Emergency Release

As you would expect, the F01/F02 has an emergency release for
the automatic transmission. This functions in much the same way
as that of the E70.

The emergency release is located under the ashtray to the front of
the gear selector switch.

Rear Axle Differential
The key aim in the development of the final drive in the F01/F02
was to make considerable savings on weight at the same time as
increasing the maximum transmission capacity. The new aluminum
differential offers a weight reduction of approximately 15 % compared with previous differentials.
In addition, efficiency was further improved by efforts to achieve
optimum spline geometries. The result is a new generation of final
drives, which are also notable for their aluminum casing.

Through the use of efficient bearings, optimum spline geometries
in the oil circuit and an optimum oil volume in the differential, it was
possible to reduce friction losses and churning losses and to thereby increase efficiency even further. Together with better heat
dissipation, this has contributed to lower oil temperatures.
The differential for the F01/02 (750i/iL) is as follows:
• Differential type = 225AL
• Ratio = 3.462

• Weight (in kg) = 29.7

The gear selector switch also contains the control unit (GWS),
which is connected to the electric gearshift controller by the
PT-CAN like it was before. The second, redundant connection, is
no longer connected by the LIN bus as used to be the case, but by
the new PT-CAN2.

These differentials are recognizable by the letters "AL" in their
designation (A = aluminum casing, L = low-friction).

The connection to the automatic transmission is a screw-fitted
one. At the rear axle differential end, it is push-fitted as it is on the
E70. However, this is the first time that a push-fit connection with
flexible coupling has been used. The center connection is a slide
piece connection with universal joint.

Driveshaft and Axles
The driveshaft on the F01 is made from steel and designed to
meet the torque requirements of the N63 engine.

In addition to torque transfer, key aims in the designing of the driveshaft for the F01/F02 were to satisfy demands for comfort in terms
of noise and vibration.

The driveshaft absorbs some of the impact energy in the event of a
head-on collision. Improvements have been made to the
properties of this crash function, which is integrated into the
forward driveshaft shaft tube. The compression force under which
the forward driveshaft shaft tube is meant to deform has been
further reduced with no effect on torque transfer capability.
Despite increased demands in terms of torque and comfort, it was
possible to reduce weight by comparison with the predecessor
model.
Axle Shafts

The F01/F02 has axle shafts that are push-fit at each end, i.e.
wheel end and differential end. The axles shafts on the N63 engine
have solid shafts.

Due to the position of the rear axle differential, the drive shafts on
the left and right have a different overall length.

Universal joint

Push-fit connection

The joints, shaft junctions and shaft diameters were designed in
such a way that no disturbance noise or vibrations at the connecting points are transmitted through the body.

On the F01/F02, the driveshaft is connected to the automatic
transmission and rear axle differential exclusively by flexible
couplings. This minimizes high-frequency gear tooth noise
at the rear axle differential.

Overview of the Bus Systems in the F01/F02

This information contained within this workbook deals with the bus
systems of the F01/F02. In addition to the following overview of
bus systems, you will find a further overview of the bus systems on
the fold-out pages contained within this workbook.

The fold-out page provides you with an immediate reference to the
bus overview while working with the workbook.

Structure in Vehicle
With deployment of the central gateway module, the F01/F02 has a
newly linked bus structure. The engine management and
chassis control systems are linked across the PT-CAN (or PT-CAN
2) and the FlexRay bus system to the central gateway module
(ZGM).

The control units of the general vehicle electrics are connected
across the K-CAN and K-CAN 2.

The MOST is the information carrier for the majority of control units
in the area of information and communication technologies.

The vehicle diagnosis communicates across the D-CAN.
The vehicle is programmed/encoded via the Ethernet access point.
The sub-bus system LIN has other links. CAN - Ethernet - FlexRay
- LIN - An exact description of these bus systems can be found in
this workbook and the ST811 Reference Information.

Overall Network of the F01/F02

K-CAN 2

Bus Systems
The following innovations have been implemented in the bus
systems in the new BMW F01/F02:
• PT-CAN with additional PT-CAN 2 (500 kBit/s)

• K-CAN with additional K-CAN 2 (500 kBits/s)

• FlexRay has been expanded and has replaced the F-CAN from
previous models.

• Ethernet (fast programming access)

• LIN bus system with extended functions.

The overall network in the F01/F02 consists of various bus systems that enable communication between the individual control
units. In view of the increasing interconnection of the control units,
it is possible to use the sensors of one system throughout the network.
The sensors are connected to the control unit that initially requires
the information logic-based and virtually in real time. This information, however, can also be made available to other control units.
Using the example of the vertical dynamics management (VDM),
initially, the VDM control unit picks up the ride-height levels of the
wheels using height-level sensors. The automatic headlight vertical aim control can also use this information for the purpose of
adapting the beam throw of the headlights.

The VDM makes available the information via the corresponding
bus systems (VDM - FlexRay - ZGM - K-CAN 2 - FRM) to the
footwell module.

This workbook contains a detailed description of the Ethernet
system, of the FlexRay bus and of the LIN bus sub-bus system.
Overview of Bus Systems
In principle, a distinction is made between two groups of bus
systems:
• Main bus systems: Ethernet, FlexRay, KCAN, K-CAN 2,
MOST, PT-CAN and PTCAN 2

• Sub-bus systems: BSD, D-CAN (diagnosis on CAN), LIN,
Local-CAN.

Main-bus systems are responsible for the data exchange between
the ECUs throughout the vehicle system. This includes system
functions such as diagnosis, programming and encoding.

PT-CAN 2
(powertrain)

Linear, 2 wire

The main bus systems are responsible for cross-system data
exchange.

Sub-bus systems exchange data within one function group.

For example, the data of the rain-light-solar-condensation sensor
are read in by the junction box electronics, processed and forwarded to the wiper module.

Changes to Main Bus Systems

The most important changes to the changes systems in the
F01/F02 are:

The connection between the control units of the rain-light-solarcondensation sensor and junction box electronics is a sub-bus and
designed as a LIN bus.

• Ethernet - fast vehicle programming access

• Powering up certain bus systems also possible
without wake-up line (now KCAN 2).

The central gateway module interlinks all the main bus systems.

Diagnosis Can (D-CAN)
The F01/F02 will continue will the D-CAN for diagnostic communication. In order for the F01 to communicate with the latest BMW
diagnostic equipment, the ICOM A must be used.

The diagnosis socket is located under the dashboard on the
driver's side. The ICOM A is used as the interface to the BMW
diagnosis system.
On board access (OBD) in the vehicle will remain unchanged.
The pin assignments are as follows:
• 16 = Terminal 30
• 5 = Terminal 31

• 14 + 6 = Communication connections

• 3, 11, 12, 13 = Ethernet connections.
• 8 = activation of Ethernet.

Location of D-CAN Connection

In addition, the D-CAN on the F01 uses a pair of terminal resistors
on the D-CAN circuit. One is located in the ZGM, the other is
located in the wiring harness between the diagnostic connector
(OBD II) and ZGM.

K-CAN
The bus systems used to date are also used in the F01/F02.
The K-CAN is responsible for communication of the components
with a low data transfer rate. The K-CAN is also connected to the
other bus systems via the central gateway module.

K-CAN 2
The K-CAN 2 is responsible for communication of the control units
with a high data transfer rate. The K-CAN 2 is also connected to
the other bus systems via the central gateway module (ZGM).
A LIN-Bus as a sub-bus is connected to all control units in the
K-CAN 2. The K-CAN 2 can be wakened via any of these sub
busses, without an additional (hardwire) wake-up line. This is represented by the “wake authorized” symbol
next to all of the
control units of K-CAN 2 on the Bus Overview. (See bus chart below).

The K-CAN is set up as line topology. Some control units in the
K-CAN have a LIN bus as sub-bus. The K-CAN has a data transfer
rate of 100 kBit/s and is designed as a twisted pair of wires.
The K-CAN has the possibility to be operated as a single-wire bus
in the event of a fault.

To provide a rapid start enable, the CAS has an additional
redundant bus connection to the DME. On this CAS bus, the data
are transferred per K bus protocol.

The K-CAN control unit is wakened via the bus, without an additional wake-up line.

Ethernet

Ethernet is a manufacturer-neutral, cable bound network technology. Most computer networks nowadays are based on this data
transfer technology.

Ethernet

ZGM

The so-called Ethernet was developed more than 30 years ago.
Since then, the data transfer rates have multiplied. The Ethernet is
the F01 has a data transfer rate of 100 MBit/s.

Application in the F01/F02
The Ethernet in the diagnosis socket is only enabled when the
BMW programming system (ICOM A) is connected. There is an
activation bridge in the programming connector, between pins 8
and 16. This switches the power supply for the Ethernet controller
in the central gateway module.

OBD2

CIC

Features of Ethernet

• Very high data rate of 100 MBit/s

This means that Ethernet access to the central gateway module is
disabled while the vehicle is being driven by the customer.

• System start time with connection setup and address assignment under three seconds, sleeping under one second
• System access only via BMW programming systems.

Security
Each participant in an Ethernet has an individually assigned ID
number, a MAC address (Media Access Control). This address and
the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) identifies the vehicle to the
BMW programming system on connection setup. This prevents
changes to the data records and stored values by third parties.

Functions of Ethernet

• Faster programming of the vehicle in Service

• Transmission of media data between ZGM and CIC

The wiring between the diagnosis socket and ZGM is with two
pairs of wires without additional shielding. There is also an activating line that supplies the Ethernet controllers in the control units
with voltage.

In the same way as in a computer network in the office, each
device in a network must receive unique identification. This is why
the central gateway module is assigned a so-called IP address by
the programming system after connection setup.

The function of an IP address in a network corresponds to that of a
telephone number in the telephone network. This IP address is
assigned per DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
This is a method of automatic allocation for IP addresses to user
devices in a network.

FlexRay - Application in the F01/F02

In the F01/F02, the FlexRay bus system is being used for the first
time across systems to network dynamic driving control systems
and the engine management system in a series vehicle.

The central gateway module sets up the link between the various
bus systems and the FlexRay.

FlexRay Bus Topology on the F01
The FlexRay is shown in a simplified form in the overview of the
bus systems. The actual topology is shown in the illustration.

The ZGM contains two so-called star couplers, each with four bus
drivers. The bus drivers forward the data of the control units via the
communication controller to the central gateway module (ZGM).
Depending on the type of termination the FlexRay control units
have, they are connected to these bus drivers in two different ways.
Bus Termination
In the same way as most bus systems, resistors for termination
(as bus termination) are also used at both ends of the data lines
on the FlexRay to prevent reflections on the lines.

The value of these terminal resistors is determined from the data
transfer rate and cable lengths. The terminal resistors are located
in the control units.

If the connection at the control unit is not the physical finish node
(e.g. DSC, ICM and DME at the bus driver BD2), it is referred to as
a FlexRay transmission and forwarding line. In this case, both of
the components must be terminated at the ends of each bus path
with terminal resistors.

If only one control unit is connected to a bus driver (e.g. SZL to
the bus driver BD0), the connections on the bus driver and on
the control unit are fitted with a terminal resistor. This type of
connection at the central gateway module is called "end node
termination".

This connection option exists for the central gateway module and a
number of control units. However, the control unit with a transmission and forwarding line has a 'non end node termination' for data
pickup. This type of termination cannot be tested using measurement systems at the control unit connector due to its resistor /
capacitor circuit. To measure the (current-free) FlexRay bus to
determine the line or terminating resistance, please be sure to
use the vehicle wiring diagram.

F01 Workbook - Module 1

46

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Wiring

The wiring of the FlexRay bus in the F01/F02 is executed as a
sheathed, two-wire, twisted cable. The sheathing protects the
wires from mechanical damage.

Some of the terminal resistors are located in the central gateway
module and in the user devices. Since the surge impedance
(impedance of high frequency lines) of the lines depends on external influencing factors, the terminating resistors are precisely
matched to the required resistance.
The sections of line to the user devices can be checked relatively
easily by means of a resistance measuring instrument (ohmmeter,
multimeter). The resistance should be measured from the central
gateway module. Pin assignment, see 'BMW diagnostic system'.
The terminal resistors in the FlexRay are located in the control
units:
• Central gateway module (ZGM)

• Electronic Damper Control satellites. (EDC_All)
• Digital Motor Electronics (DME)

• Dynamic Stability Control (DSC)

• Rear-axle drift angle control (HSR)

• Steering column switch cluster (SZL)
• Lane change warning (SWW).

Measurements on the FlexRay
For resistance measurement in the FlexRay, be sure to observe the
vehicle wiring diagram! The various termination options mean that
misinterpretations of the measurement results can occur.

Measuring the resistance of the FlexRay lines cannot provide a
100% deduction in terms of the system wiring. In the case of damage such as pinching or connector corrosion, the resistance value
may be within the tolerance when the system is static.

In dynamic mode, however, electrical influences can cause
increased surge resistance, resulting in data transmission problems.

It is possible to repair the FlexRay bus. If damaged, the cables can
be connected using conventional cable connectors. Special
requirements, however, must be observed when reinstalling the
system.
The wiring of the FlexRay system consists of twisted lines. Where
possible, this twisting should not be altered during repairs.
Repaired areas with stripped insulation must be sealed again with
shrink-fit tubing. Moisture can affect the surge resistance and
therefore the efficiency of the bus system.
Wake-up and Sleep Characteristics

Although the FlexRay control units can be wakened per bus signal,
most FlexRay control units are activated across an additional wakeup line by the CAS. The wake-up line has the same function as the
previous wake-up line (15WUP) in the PT-CAN.
The signal curve corresponds to the signal curve of the PT-CAN.
The active steering and the VDM are not wakened via the wake-up
cable, rather per bus signal. The four damper satellites are then
activated directly by the VDM by switching the power supply.

MOST Bus

The following overview shows one of the possible equipment
configurations.

On the F01/F02, the MOST bus is, for the most part, identical to
previous models with regard to operation and function. There are
some changes unique to these models which are outlined below.

• Telephone.

Fiber Optic Connector

The use of the fiber optic connector provides the advantage of
being able to easily retrofit control units in the area of the luggage
compartment.

• Rear Seat Entertainment

• ULF-SBX high

The fiber optic cable connector is located in the luggage compartment of the F01/F02, to the left behind the side wall trim.
The fiber optic cable connector is arranged in the MOST bus
system between the front area of the vehicle (head unit, DVD
changer) and the rear area of the vehicle (TCU,SBX etc.).

The MOST programming access used in models to date is no
longer required for the F01/F02. The programming now takes
place on these vehicles via the Ethernet access point.
Light Direction

Data are always sent in one direction on the MOST bus.
Each control unit can send data on the MOST bus.

Two fiber optic connectors are installed in the F01. One is responsible for the factory installed control units. The other is used for the
preparations for options.

The physical light direction runs from the master control unit (Car
Information Computer) to the DVD changer, to the instrument cluster, to the ZGM (Central Gateway Module) and from there to the
fiber optic cable distributor/connector. All the control units fitted in
the rear end are connected at the fiber optic cable distributor. From
the last control unit, the light returns to the master control unit.

Local CAN
The Local-CAN serves to transfer the high data volumes of the
following sensors to the ICM.
• Short-range and long range radar sensors to the ICM.

The Local-CAN has a data transfer rate of 500 kBit/s and is
designed as a twisted pair of wires.

The terminal resistors in the Local-CAN are located in the ICM and
the long range radar sensor:

BSD
The bit-serial data interface BSD is also used on the F01/F02
(due to lack of available interfaces). It makes the following connections from the engine management to the corresponding sub
systems:
• Alternator regulator

• Oil condition sensor

K-bus Protocol
The term "K-bus (protocol)" is used for a series of sub-bus
systems in the bus overview. These sub-bus systems are used for
various purposes. The K-bus protocol used here is a common
component already used in predecessor models. The protocol is
used, e.g. on the following systems:
• Connection between ACSM and TCU

• Comfort Access

• CAS bus

LIN bus
The LIN bus has been used as early as the E60 and was also used
to control the outside mirrors on the E46. Mainly, the versions V2.0
or higher are used in the F01/F02. For the F01/F02, various
connections per LIN bus are implemented:
• E.g.: Footwell module to driver's door switch cluster

• Connection from footwell module to the outside mirrors

• Connection from roof functions center to rain-light-solar-condensation sensor

• Activation of the 16 IHKA actuator motors per "daisy chain"
assignment (series connection of the signal lines).

Due to the lower data rate on the LIN bus, terminal resistors are not
used.

However, all V2.0 secondary control units also require a V2.x master controller.

In the F01/F02, the following control units still correspond to the
V1.x specification:

A number of the connected components are only diagnosis-capable to a limited degree, for example the rain-light-solar-condensation sensor.

• Belt hand-over

In this case, the master control unit serves as the gateway to the
remaining bus system. The diagnosis requests from the ZGM or
BMW diagnosis system are inserted in the sporadic section of a
LIN frame.

• Outside mirror

• Blower output stages

• Intelligent Battery Sensor

A special feature in the F01/F02 is that the data communication
between the Comfort Access and diversity antenna is implemented
with 20.0 kBit/s due to the large number of small data packages.

LIN V2.0 (or V2.1)
LIN components that correspond to the specification of data protocol LIN V2.0 or higher have extended functions.

The slightly higher transfer rate means that the time slots in the
data protocol can be better exploited. The master control unit
sends the "sleep command" to place the LIN in the idle state.

• The LIN components for V2.x are delivered with a device ID
and a base configuration. The final (dynamic) configuration
and the allocation of the ID number take place on commissioning by the master control unit.

The "sleep command" can also be sent with terminal R "On", e.g.
for mirror adjustment. The "wake-up command" can also be sent
by a secondary control unit.

If one of these components is replaced, this operation must be
initiated manually by means of the BMW diagnosis system.

The LIN messages in the data protocol are divided into four
sections:

• The data protocol has become more variable, permitting, if
required, periodic alongside sporadic messages as of specification V2.0. These "sporadic frames" are only sent if the master control unit requires data from the secondary control units
or outputs data. Without such a request, the time slots in the
messages remain empty.

• Synchronization

• Identifier
• Data

• Checksum

• The master control units can send so-called multiple requests
to secondary control unit groups. To reduce the bus load, the
contacted secondary control units only respond in the case of
changed values (e.g. door contact).
All master control units of the LIN V2.x specification are
downwardly compatible to (secondary control units) components of previous specifications.

Voltage Supply

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Overview of System Components

The voltage supply in the F01/F02 consists of the following
components:
• Vehicle battery

• Distribution box on the battery

• Front fuse carrier, behind the glove compartment
• Rear fuse carrier on the right-hand side of the
luggage compartment
• Intelligent battery sensor IBS
• SBK safety battery terminal
• Battery cables

• Junction box electronics

• Power distribution box in engine compartment
• Electronics box in engine compartment
• Positive battery terminal
• Alternator.

Vehicle Battery
The vehicle battery is an 90 Ah AGM type fitted in the center at
the rear of the luggage compartment floor. The main advantage of
the AGM battery is its higher cycle strength.
Distribution Box
In the F01/F02, the distribution box is located in the luggage
compartment directly on top of the vehicle battery.
The distribution box on the battery is secured on the vehicle
battery by means of a metal tab.

The distribution box on the battery is equipped with fuses for the
following electric loads:
• Front fuse carrier (250 A)
• Rear fuse carrier (100 A)

• Engine compartment distribution box (100 A)
– electric fan

• Electric coolant pump (100 A)
• Intelligent battery sensor IBS.

Fuse Carriers

The distribution box on the battery must always be replaced as a
complete unit. The fuses are integrated as a complete unit in the
housing of the distribution box on the battery.

Due to the steady increase of electrically operated comfort
functions, communication and safety in BMW vehicles, the voltage
supply is becoming ever more important.

The fuses differ in terms of their power rating. The distribution box
additionally contains the power supply for the intelligent battery
sensor IBS.

In the F01/F02, there are two separate fuse carriers. The front fuse
carrier is located near to the glove compartment and the rear fuse
carrier is located on the right-hand side of the luggage compartment.

The connectors are color-coded and mechanically coded to avoid
confusion. These are high power connections, therefore always
ensure correct contacting!
Note: When replacing or working on the distribution box,
always make sure the plug connections and, above
all, the screw connections are secured properly.
Connection between battery terminal and distribution box 15 Nm.

Front Fuse Carrier
This section describes the front fuse carrier. The junction box
electronics are described in a later section. In the right-hand part
of the front fuse carrier, there is an opening through which the
junction box electronics are connected to the front fuse carrier.
Installation Location

Relays in the Front Fuse Carrier
There are a few relays in the front fuse carrier. One of these is
plugged in, the others are soldered to the circuit board.

Power Distribution Box in Engine Compartment
There are no fuses in the engine compartment distribution box.

This line is safeguarded by the high-current fuse (100 A) in the distribution box at the battery. Depending on the model of vehicle,
different line cross sections are used.

In addition, a battery cable is routed to the front fuse carrier through
the vehicle interior. The transfer points for the main power cables
are located in the luggage compartment. The main power lines on
the underbody are laid in a protected area to prevent damage.

Battery Cables
In the F01/F02, three main power lines on the underbody run from
the distribution box at the battery to the engine compartment.
One of the main power lines runs via the positive battery terminal to
the starter motor and to the alternator.
The second line powers the engine electronics (Electric coolant
pump etc). The third line runs to the distribution box in the engine
compartment. This distribution box supplies the electric fan with
power.

Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS)

The intelligent battery sensor (IBS) is a mechatronic component for
monitoring the battery status. The following physical measurements are recorded for the battery:
• Current
• Voltage

• Terminal temperature

The term "intelligent" means that there is a microprocessor
integrated in the IBS. This microprocessor calculates and analyzes
time critical measured variables. The results are then forwarded to
the higher-level control units (i.e. DME) via the LIN bus.

Bus Overview and Terminal Status

Terminal 15N
Terminal 15N is used to supply power to control units and components that are only intended to be active when the vehicle is being
driven, e.g. PDC.

The F01/F02 introduces new designations for some of the
terminals. A distinction is also made between logical terminals and
power supply terminals.

The letter N stands for "Nachlauf", meaning "overrun". The power
supply Terminal 15N is switched on and off by means of the logical
Terminal 15. The overrun time after Terminal 15N is switched off is
5 seconds. That time is required so that the control units have
enough time to save their data. While Terminal 15N is active,
Terminal 30B and Terminal 30F are also active.

The logical terminals do not serve as power supply terminals;
instead, they represent a status. They are activated/deactivated by
pressing the START-STOP button.
The logical terminals are:
• Terminal R

Terminal 30B
Terminal 30B supplies power to control units and electrical
components that are required when the driver is present.

• Terminal 15

• Terminal 50.

The letter B stands for "Basic mode".

The power supply terminals on the F01 has been changed, the
following table reflects the changes:
Previous terminal designations

New terminal designations

KL30g

KL 30B

KL15

KL30g_f
KL30

Terminal 30B is activated by:

• Pressing the buttons on the radio remote control
• Unlocking/locking/double-locking the vehicle

KL 15N

• Pressing the START-STOP button

• Change of door switch status, change of trunk
switch status, change of side window position

KL 30F
KL30

• Bus message.

For clearer illustration of terminal shut-down, the control units are
identified by a colored triangle. Identification and allocation to the
individual terminals are shown in the diagram below.

Regular deactivation by:

• Vehicle double-locked and trunk closed
(one minute overrun)

• Vehicle not double-locked or trunk open
(30 minutes overrun).

F01 Workbook - Module 1

67

68

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Other possible deactivation triggers:

• Upper starting capacity limit reached (one minute overrun)

• "Powerdown": diagnosis command for purposes of measuring
closed-circuit (10 seconds overrun)
• Transport mode (one minute overrun).

While Terminal 30B is active, Terminal 30F is also active.

Terminal 30F
Terminal 30F supplies power to control units and electrical devices
that are also required when the driver is not present but which can
be switched off in the event of a fault.

All control units that are not supplied by Terminal 15N or Terminal
30B, are not responsible for vehicle access and do not have to
meet a legal requirement for permanent operation.

The letter F stands for "Fault".

Terminal 30F is activated by:

• Pressing the buttons on the radio remote control
• Unlocking/locking/double-locking the vehicle
• Pressing the START-STOP button

• Change of door switch status, change of trunk switch status,
change of side window position

• Bus message.

In the event of a fault (closed-circuit current too high, bus wake-up,
sleep-mode inhibitor, start capacity limit reached) Terminal 30F is
reset for 10 seconds.

Terminal 30F is not reset or switched off if at least one of the
following conditions is met:
• Terminal 30B active

• Parking lights switched on
• Side lights switched on

• Hazard warning lights switched on

• If an extended overrun time for Terminals 30B and 30F is
demanded by a service message from any of a number of
control units.

Example: when the engine is warm, it can be necessary for
the electric fan to run on for up to 11 minutes after the vehicle
is parked and locked. In order for the electric fan to be operated, the engine management module must be supplied with
power. Since the overrun time in that case is only three minutes (that is currently the short overrun time for Terminal 30B,
not one minute), the DME requests the appropriate extension
by way of a bus message when the engine is switched off.

• "Sticking relay" detected.

Terminal 30F is switched off if Terminal 30B is off and at least one
of the following conditions is met:
• Starting capacity limit reached

• Another 10 bus wake-ups have occurred after Terminal 30F
reset
• Unexplained bus activity after Terminal 30F reset

• Violation of closed-circuit current limit detected after Terminal
30F reset.

Workshop Exercise - Logical Terminal Control

Using the supplied poster and the instructor designated vehicle, solve the exercise as outlined by your instructor.
Complete by answering the following questions.

When pressing the START/STOP button once (engine off), without
depressing the brake, what terminals can be switched on and off?

How long will the vehicle stay in KL15 after shutting the engine off
(in Neutral)?

How is Terminal R achieved?

What, if anything, will extend the time in KL15 in the above
situation?

When in Terminal R, what happens when the START/STOP button
is pressed?

What happens if there is an attempt to lock the vehicle with the
remote while the vehicle is in neutral (in KL15).

without depressing the brake

when depressing the brake

Why would it be necessary to shut off the engine with the transmission in Neutral?

How long will the vehicle stay in KLR? (without changing any status
i.e. doors or remote control operation)

When the engine is running, what happens when the START/STOP
button is pressed while the transmission is in Neutral?

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Terminal Relays
The F01/F02 has various relays for switching off the power supply
to most control units. The Junction box module controls the
bistable relays for Terminal 30F but receives the request from the
central gateway module (ZGM) or IBS.
• ZGM:

If sleep mode inhibited or on occurrence of unauthorized
wake-up. ZGM monitors the vehicle status and registers
inhibited sleep mode or unauthorized wake-up after Terminal
30B is switched off.

• IBS:

If closed-circuit current limit violated or starting capacity limit
reached.

The computation for activating the Terminal 30F relay takes place
on two control units. The ZGM monitors the following activities:
• Invalid wake-up procedures within the bus systems

• Sleep blockers (control units that constantly keep the bus
systems active).

The ECM (DME) continuously reads and assesses the battery data.
The relay is also switched off when the starting capability limit of
the vehicle battery is reached.
The Terminal 30F relay is a bistable relay and is always in the ON
state under normal conditions. It switches off the connected
electric loads only in the case of fault. Once the Terminal 30F relay
has been switched off, one of the switch-on conditions must be
met before it can be switched on again.
General Measures

The terminals "load shut-down" and the terminal "interior lighting"
are switched off as a general measure when the vehicle is in
stationary mode. This occurs only when the vehicle is not locked
and secured. These loads are shut down immediately when the
vehicle is locked and secured. This measure affects the following
electric loads:
Electrical loads

Interior lighting
(front and rear)

Load shut-down after 8 minutes
(immediately if doublelocked)

Reading light

(front and rear)

Vanity mirror light

Load shut-down after 8 minutes

Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS)

The time required to take the readings is approximately 50 milliseconds. The measured data is stored on the IBS in the memory for
recording the closed-circuit current.

The intelligent battery sensor has a similar range of functions to the
intelligent battery sensor on previous models. A new feature is
data transmission between the IBS and the ECM (DME) via LIN
bus and the wake-up function of the IBS.

The wake-up function applies only when the vehicle is in idle
mode. If the IBS detects a wake-up trigger, the Junction box
module is woken up by a PWM signal. The IBS is directly connected to the Junction box module via a separate lead.
The pulse duty factor indicates the reason for the wake-up:

Raised closed-circuit current

A wake-up due to raised closed-circuit current can take place up to
three times. Depending on the vehicle status and reason for the
wake-up, the Junction box module performs one of the following
actions:

Wake-up Function

When the vehicle is in idle mode, the IBS continuously records the
data relevant to the battery indicators. The IBS is programmed to
wake up every 14 seconds in order to update the measured data
by taking new readings.
F01 Workbook - Module 1

71

72

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Commissioning
The IBS is fully functional as soon as it is completely connected,
i.e. it can immediately detect the basic variables, current, voltage
and temperature.
However, the variables derived from those readings for the
purposes of power management, i.e. battery condition, starting
capacity, etc., must first be recalculated and, therefore, there is a
time lag before they are available.

When the engine is restarted, the DME reads off the closed-circuit
current progression. If it diverges from the defined closed-circuit
current progression, a fault is registered in the DME fault memory.
In the period between "Engine OFF" and when the DME main
relay is switched off, the IBS is informed by the DME as to the
maximum charge that can be drawn from the battery on the basis
of ensuring that the engine can be reliably restarted.
After the DME main relay is switched off, the IBS continually
checks the battery charge level (SOC) and the closed-circuit
current.
Junction Box Module

The Junction box module is
responsible for switching the
Terminal 30F relay and for
storing information (history data
and fault memory entries)
related to energy management.

As part of vehicle diagnostics,
these data can be used to evaluate faults and to analyze the
vehicle battery.

Engine Management (power management)

The (power management) software for controlling the energy
balance is located in the engine management (DME). On the basis
of that control algorithm, various electrical devices in the vehicle's
electrical system are switched off by the CAS control unit via the
Terminal 30B relay or by the Central Gateway Module and engine
management module via the Terminal 30F relay. The power management is additionally responsible for evaluating and storing the
IBS data.

Transport Mode
The batteries in vehicles coming off the production line are
adequately charged so that SOC > 80 % (SOC = "State of
charge").

Note: If the SOC has dropped to less than 35 %, the indication continues to be displayed on the instrument
cluster until the battery is replaced and a change of
battery is registered.

However, since several days or weeks can pass between the time
the vehicle comes off the production line and when it is delivered
to the customer, the battery will have discharged to a greater or
lesser degree. Therefore, every battery must be charged according
to the recharging calendar.

Note: When transport mode is reset, there is no indication
on the instrument cluster of the battery charge level.
Note: If the vehicle is delivered with the red Check Control
message “Battery charge level very low” active, it is
essential that the low battery charge is recorded as
“transport damage” on the delivery note.

The F01/F02 is the first model on which it is possible to display the
charge level of the battery when the new car is being transported.

The driving profile for the last 5 weeks is stored in the JBE
energy history memory. The energy history memory is referred
to for energy diagnosis purposes.

Electrical System and Battery Diagnosis
Over the past few years, the energy management of all BMW
models has been continuously improved and standardized across
the various model series. In terms of energy diagnosis, this also
means standardization of testing schedules and displays in the
BMW diagnostic system.

More information on the subject of energy management on the
F01/F02 can be found in the BMW Diagnosis System.

The aim of the diagnostic procedures is to show the causes of a
discharged battery as unambiguously as possible. In view of the
complexity, especially in the area of energy management, the
specific cause of a fault can be shown only partially depending on
its nature.

The acquired energy diagnosis data are shown if the fault cannot
be clearly assigned based on the acquired data. Power management is retained in full while the expanded diagnostic options are
now resident in the history memory.

ZGM monitors the vehicle status, registers inhibited sleep mode or
unauthorized wakeup after Terminal 30B is switched off and
requests a reset or shut-down of Terminal 30F by a bus message
to the JBE.

Car Access System
CAS 4

The Car Access System introduced on the F01 is now the 4th
generation. There are several changes as compared to past
vehicles which include:
• Integration of the Comfort Access functions into CAS 4

• Passive Go is now standard equipment (1st time for BMW)
• Elimination of slot for ID transmitter (key)

Comfort Access remains an option, but Passive go is standard.
Therefore, the ID transmitter only needs to be somewhere inside
the passenger compartment for the engine to be started.

The ID transmitter is fitted with a battery which has a life of
approximately four years. Up to eight ID transmitters can be used
for a particular vehicle. Four of the eight ID transmitters can be
used for personal profiles.
Functional Overview
The Car Access System 4 provides, among other things, the
central control unit for vehicle access and vehicle locking.
Consequently, the CAS 4 has complete control over central
locking.

The CAS 4 has sole knowledge of the system and decides
whether, for instance, to allow access to the vehicle or not.
In other words, whether to unlock the vehicle or not. That function
is referred to as a master function.

The Car Access System 4 incorporates the following master
functions on the F01/F02:
• Comfort Access

• Central locking

• Power windows

• Sliding/tilting sunroof
• Terminal control

• Data transmission for Condition Based Service (CBS).
• Checking plausibility of remote control signals.

The Car Access System 4 enables or disables the execution of a
number of functions. However, other control units may be involved
in the execution of the function. A selection of them is listed in the
table below.
JBE

ID transmitter search in passenger compartment
When the START-STOP button is pressed, it triggers the search for
an ID transmitter in the passenger compartment. The passenger
compartment search is required for the Passive Go function in
order that starting can be enabled.

Selection of function-executing control modules

FRM
FZD

When performing the passenger compartment search, the CAS 4
issues a request for an ID transmitter to register with the vehicle.

Central locking

There are two antennas provided for the passenger compartment
search. One antenna covers the front of the passenger compartment and the other the rear. The antennas are connected to the
CAS 4.

Power windows

Sliding/tilting sunroof

For the purposes of communication with other electrical-system
devices, the CAS 4 is connected to the K-CAN2, CAS bus and LIN
bus.

The CAS 4 sends out a signal with a frequency of 125 KHz
through the antennas. That signal triggers the ID transmitter to
register with the vehicle.

The Car Access System 4 analyzes the status of the hood switch
and broadcasts this information for use by the alarm system.

The ID transmitter responds with an encrypted radio signal.
The remote control receiver in the diversity module passes the
radio signal information to the CAS 4 via the LIN bus.

The Car Access System 4 also analyzes the status of the following
buttons and initiates the central locking function:

The CAS checks whether the ID transmitter belongs to the vehicle.
Subsequent communication takes place on the ID transmitter's
transmission frequency, e.g. 315 MHz

• Center Lock button, locking/unlocking central locking

• Interior trunk release button on A-pillar, unlocking trunk

• Central double-locking button, locking and double-locking
vehicle doors using button on underside of open trunk

The CAS 4 checks whether the ID transmitter matches the vehicle.
If the check is positive, the CAS 4 enables terminal control.
The individual terminals can then be selected.

• Hotel setting switch, preventing trunk unlocking function.

The Car Access System 4 provides the power supply for the brake
light switch and also analyzes its status.

Note: If communication with the ID transmitter can not be
established, a Check Control message is displayed
on the instrument cluster. The driver is notified that
no ID transmitter could be located inside the passenger compartment.

The sections that follow describe some of the functions of the Car
Access System. Those functions are:
• Terminal control

• Electronic immobilizer

The ID transmitter can be held in the position marked on the
steering column. There is an emergency start coil under the steering column trim. Communication between the CAS 4 and the ID
transmitter can be established via the emergency start coil.

• Gearbox enable

• Vehicle data storage.

Input/Output CAS 4

The Car Access System 4 (2) is responsible for terminal control.
For instance "Terminal 15 ON" is made available to the intelligent
battery sensor (4). The terminal statuses, e.g. "Terminal 15
ON/Terminal 0", can be selected by means of the START-STOP
button (11). In conjunction with the digital motor electronics (3),
the Car Access System 4 issues the start enabling signal for the
starter motor (5).

Electronic Immobilizer 4

As soon as an attempt is made to start the engine, a check
(authentication) has to be carried out. That check establishes
whether a matching ID transmitter is located in the passenger
compartment. The vehicle can be started if the check is successful. Authentication starts with the status "Terminal 15 ON".

The EWS 4 was first introduced with the Car Access System 3 on
the E92 and the latest version is a derivation of that design.

Design of the EWS 4 System
The vehicle immobilizer consists of the identification transmitter
which identifies itself to the vehicle and therefore to the CAS 4.
The CAS 4 system exchanges data via the CAS bus with the digital
motor electronics in order to cancel the immobilizer function.

Note: The ID transmitter also has to identify itself to the
vehicle and, therefore, to the Car Access System 4.

Note: The time taken to search for an ID transmitter in the
passenger compartment may result in a delay before
engine starting is enabled. That delay may occur in a
time span of up to half a second.
Start enable through the electronic vehicle immobilizer
The start procedure is enabled by means of a special request and
response procedure known as challenge-response.

Index

Explanation

Index

As of "Terminal 15 ON", the digital motor electronics sends an
encrypted random number to the CAS 4. The digital motor electronics uses a random number generator to generate the random
number.

Transponder coil

On the basis of that random number and its secret key, the CAS 4
calculates a response and sends it to the digital motor electronics.
In the meantime, the digital motor electronics calculates the
expected response from the random number and its secret key.

The software for the electronic immobilizer and for enabling engine
starting is incorporated in the Car Access System 4.

Enabling of ignition and fuel injection is the responsibility of the
digital motor electronics. Before the electronic immobilizer issues
the enabling signal for starting, the ID transmitter must be identified
as matching the vehicle.
F01 Workbook - Module 1

83

84

F01 Workbook - Module 1

The CAS 4 and the digital motor electronics use the same secret
key and algorithm for the calculations. If the figure that the CAS 4
sends to the digital motor electronics matches the figure calculated
by the motor electronics, the electronic immobilizer is deactivated.
The engine can now be started.
Note: As from "Terminal 15 ON", a cyclic query (challengeresponse) is performed as long as the engine is not
yet running.

Data Transmission
Data transmission is redundant via the bus systems.

The signal from the digital motor electronics, for instance, reaches
the CAS via both the K-CAN2 and the CAS bus. The digital motor
electronics, however, is connected to the PT-CAN.
For that reason, the signal is transferred from PT-CAN to the
K-CAN 2 by the central gateway module. The time taken by the
signals via the different bus systems is of no consequence as the
signal that reaches the digital motor electronics first used for the
electronic immobilizer.
The authentication is repeated in response to following events:
• Transmission and response time exceeded

• Transmission problems

• Response with the secret security code incorrect (e.g. incorrect secret key due to control unit from another vehicle).

Secret Key
The control units are assigned a secret key on the assembly line.
This secret key is generated from a random number. The secret
key is valid for a pair of control units and linked to the specific
vehicle. This means that one pair of control units receives the same
secret key.

Once the secret key has been entered, the control unit is locked.
From this point on, the control unit is permanently tied to this
secret key and the vehicle.
The CAS 4 and the digital motor electronics form a control unit
pairing.

Note: Since the control units are assigned to the specific
vehicle, replacement with a unit from another vehicle
is not possible.
When replacing a control unit, the new control unit
must be ordered from BMW. Matching of the control
units to each other is no longer necessary.

Gearbox Enable

The enable is based on a procedure similar to that used for the
electronic vehicle immobilizer 3.

As of "Terminal 15 ON", the CAS 4 sends encrypted individual
codes to the transmission control unit. The signal is applied to the
PT-CAN 2 by the digital motor electronics.
The electronic transmission control deciphers and checks these
individual codes. If the check is successful, the gearbox control
unit will enable the gearbox functions.
The electronic gearbox control unit forms a pair of control units
together with the CAS 4.
Start Value Matching

A start value matching procedure between the CAS 4 and the
electronic transmission control is performed on the assembly line.
That involves the CAS 4 transferring an encrypted individual code
to the transmission control unit.
Consequently, the electronic transmission control knows the
individual code and can check whether the gearbox functions can
be enabled.

Components of the Car Access System

Emergency Start Coil
In unfavorable situations, the system may not be able to find the ID
transmitter in the passenger compartment. For that reason, the
Car Access System initiates display of a message on the instrument cluster.

CAS 4
Due to the integration of the Passive Go function, the START-STOP
button is now connected to the Car Access System 4 via the
instrument panel wiring harness.

The message notifies the
driver that no ID transmitter
could be located inside the
passenger compartment.

The CAS has a separate connector socket for the Comfort Access
system. The CAS 4 has three connector sockets in all.
Index
1

3

Since the F01/F02 does not
have a slot for the ID transmitter, there is an emergency
start coil (1) on the steering
column.

Explanation

Cockpit connector, 26-pin

Comfort access connector 26-pin
Vehicle wiring harness connector
41-pin

The emergency start coil can be used to communicate with the ID
transmitter so that the engine can still be started and the vehicle
driven.

Note: The instrument panel is pre-assembled so that it is
fitted in the car as a complete unit on the assembly
line. For that reason, the Car Access System 4 has
only one connector for the main wiring harness.

The emergency start coil is equivalent to the function of the
transponder coil. By communicating via the transponder coil, the
Car Access System 4 is able to identify a valid ID transmitter.

Thus the Car Access System 4 is able to issue the start enabling
signal following successful identification.

All other connectors are connected up during preassembly of the instrument panel.

In the following situations, for example, the system may not be
able to find the ID transmitter:

On vehicles without Comfort Access, the Car Access System does
not have the Comfort Access connector socket (2).

• ID transmitter defective

START-STOP Button
The START-STOP button is integrated in the instrument panel.
In contrast with the previous connection, the ribbon cable has been
eliminated.

• Interference with radio transmission to ID transmitter
• Discharged battery in ID transmitter.

F01 Workbook - Module 1

86

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Remote Control Receiver
The remote control receiver now has a transmitter and receiver unit
and is integrated in the diversity module. As a result, bi-directional
communication can be established between the ID transmitter and
the remote-control receiver.
The remote control receiver now also has a LIN bus connection.
The remote control receiver uses that LIN bus connection to wake
up the Car Access System 4.

In that case, the Car Access System 4 asks the remote control
receiver if there is a message waiting. That message may contain a
request to unlock the vehicle. The Car Access System checks, for
instance, whether the ID transmitter belongs to the vehicle.

If the check is positive, the Car Access System 4 initiates unlocking
of the vehicle.
Note: As a LIN-bus device, the remote control receiver is an
input capable of waking up the Car Access System.

Input Components
The Car Access System 4 analyzes buttons for the central locking
functions. All buttons connect to ground. That means that the Car
Access System 4 receives a low signal when the button is pressed.

The buttons concerned are:
• Center-lock button

• Interior trunk release button on A- pillar

• Central double-locking button on underside of trunk
• Hotel setting switch

• Hood switch (alarm system).

Vehicle Data Storage

The Car Access System 4 stores the following vehicle data:

• Personal Profile, the Car Access System 4 stores data for the
Personal Profile

• Vehicle order, the vehicle order is stored in the footwell module
• Redundant data storage for instrument cluster
• Data for condition-based service CBS

• Service key data (e.g. data for Condition Based Service,
fault memory entries, Check Control messages, etc.)
• Authentication for diagnostic access to the CAS 4

The Car Access System's temporary memory permanently stores
data such as the Condition Based Service version, the vehicle
identification number (VIN), software version, etc.
The Car Access System receives current data from the electrical
system, such as outside temperature, engine temperature, date,
time and odometer reading, via the K-CAN2.

The Car Access System collects that information. Under certain
conditions, the data is transferred to the ID transmitter. In that way,
the service key data is kept up to date for readout when the vehicle
is taken in for servicing.

Updating Service Data
The service data records and fault memory entries are collected in
a temporary memory by the CAS. The service data is thus
available from a central point.
Index

Updating Service Key Data
The service key data is stored in the Car Access System and transferred to the ID transmitter. Transfer is initiated automatically by
specific conditions or manually. The data can be read out using
the BMW Key Reader when the vehicle is serviced.

F01 Workbook - Module 1

The conditions for updating are:

• "Terminal 15 ON", speed above 25 mph followed by speed
below 25 mph.

• The data is updated once a distance of 5 miles has been
covered and the speed is below 25 mph.

• The remote control receiver transfers the data to the ID
transmitter when the engine is switched off. Data continues to
be written to the ID transmitter even after it is taken out of the
vehicle.

• A data read-out can then be obtained from the ID transmitter.

Manual Updating

The procedure for transferring current service key data to the ID
transmitter in the course of servicing is as follows:

• Press and hold the Center-Lock button and use the STARTSTOP button to select "Terminal 15 ON", then release both
buttons.
• Within 10 seconds, hold the ID transmitter against the
right-hand side of the steering column trim in the position
marked by the key symbol.

The key symbol is printed on the steering column trim.
Wait until the Check Control message appears on the
instrument cluster. The instrument cluster display shows the
message "Updating service data".

• As soon as the updating process is complete, the Check
Control message disappears and a gong sounds.
• Data can then be obtained from the ID transmitter.

The manual updating process transfers Condition Based Service
data, Check Control messages and fault memory entries.

Control Unit Replacement
A defect in the control units belonging to the EWS represents a
challenge for the Service technician. Since a defective control
module cannot be replaced by control modules from other vehicles
particular care is necessary when performing the diagnostic procedure.

A defective control unit can be ordered through spare part channels. However, it is important to bear in mind that the digital motor
electronics and the Car Access System 4 are supplied readycoded for the vehicle.
This has the advantage that only the control unit is replaced and
the matching procedure with the electronic vehicle immobilizer is
not necessary.
There is no point in ordering a control unit to be kept in stock as
the secret key is assigned to the control unit and the vehicle.

A matching procedure is necessary for the electronic transmission
control after replacement. As part of this procedure, the Car
Access System 4 transfers the individual code to the electronic
transmission control.
The matching procedure can take several minutes.

exterior and interior. The outside door handle electronics are also
read by the Car Access System.

The antennas for the exterior are installed in the door sills on each
side of the vehicle.
The antenna for the rear of the vehicle is located in the bumper.
The exterior antennas are designed to give a coverage area of 1.5
meters (about 5 feet).
The outside door handle electronics provide the Car Access
System with the signal from the capacitive sensor and the piezo
sensor.

As far as the 5 interior antennas are concerned, there are 2 in the
luggage compartment and 1 in the parcel shelf. One is located in
the front of the center console and one in the rear of the console.
The transmission frequency for the antennas is 125 kHz.
All messages sent are encrypted.

With this information, the CAS knows the status of the door lock in
the driver's door. This is important if a request is issued to unlock
or lock the vehicle using the ID transmitter, for example.

Operation of Central Locking
The Car Access System (4) evaluates the signal from the ID transmitter (1) and requests the unlocking or locking of the vehicle.
The junction-box electronics module (8) executes the requests.

The central locking button is integrated in the underside of the
trunk lid and is part of the Comfort Access option.

The lock cylinder (12) in the driver's door is used for mechanically
unlocking or locking the door.

K-CAN 2 signals at CAS 4

The footwell module (10) evaluates the movement (status of Hall
sensors) of the lock cylinder and the status of the door contacts.

The radio signal from the ID transmitter is received by the rear
window antenna. The remote control receiver integrated in the
diversity module (19) forwards the signal to the CAS (2).

After the signal has been successfully checked, the CAS issues a
request for control of the central locking system. The CAS is the
master control unit for the central locking system.

The junction-box electronics module (4) executes the unlocking or
locking of the vehicle.

K-CAN 2.

Depending on the status, the JB electronics module activates
central locking. The junction-box electronics modules is also
responsible for registering the status and activating central locking
in the trunk.

The junction-box electronics module is also responsible for controlling the fuel filler flap (10). The footwell module evaluates the signals from the Hall sensors for the lock cylinder (16) and makes this
information available on the K-CAN2.

• One-touch opening and closing
• Toll opening and closing

• Auto-remote opening and closing.

The CAS 4 is the central control function for electric opening and
closing of the windows.

The FRM and JB electronics are responsible for the execution and
activation of the power window motors.

The footwell module and the junction box electronics monitor the
motor speed of the respective power window motors.
In this arrangement, the FRM or JB electronics can respond to
overheating or possible blocking of the power window motors in
the event of an object being trapped in the windows.

The signal from the power window switch can pass through different bus systems until the desired window is opened or closed.
Activation Example
The driver's door switch block is connected via the LIN bus to the
FRM. The signal is routed via the LIN bus to the FRM when the
power window switch for the window in the passenger's door is
operated.
The FRM drives the power window motor. The same applies for
the window in the driver's door.

The signal is routed from the driver's door switch cluster via the LIN
bus to the FRM when the power window switches for the windows
in the rear doors are operated. The FRM sends the signal via the
K-CAN to the JB electronics. The JB electronics receives the signal and activates the corresponding power window motor.

By way of example, the opening and closing procedure for one of
the rear windows is illustrated by the signal path in the following
graphic. The opening or closing function is initiated from the
driver's door switch cluster.

Power Window Operation
The Car Access System (2) issues the enable to actuate the power
window motors (5, 7, 12 and 14).
If a power window switch is then activated, the FRM (1) (front
power window motor) or the JB electronics (3) (rear power window
motor) executes the request.

Examples of the Signal Path
The following examples of a signal path show the path taken by the
signal before the power window motor opens or closes the window.
The CAS 4 has issued the enable to operate the power windows.
Driver's door switch cluster

When the power window switch for the window in the driver's door
or front passenger 's door is operated, the signal is routed via the
LIN bus to the FRM. The FRM drives the corresponding power
window motor.

The signal is routed from the driver's door switch cluster via the LIN

Sliding/Tilting Sunroof

The slide/tilt sunroof is standard on the F01/F02. Several control
units are involved in the operation of the slide/tilt sunroof.

Input/Output Sliding/tilting Sunroof

The following points should be noted:

• The sunroof utilizes 2 motors, one for the glass and one for
the shade

• The FZD controls and monitors both motors for the sunroof

• The CAS communicates with the FZD for sunroof operation
via the central locking system

• The FRM supplies the signal from the door contacts.

• The Junction Box electronics provide the power supply for the
motors via terminal 30.

• The DSC acquires the signals from the wheel speed sensors
while the ICM makes available the speed signal to the vehicle
electrical system for the operation of the wind deflector.

Slide/tilt Sunroof Operating Concept
The button for operating the slide/tilt sunroof has three directions
of movement. In addition to the manual and overpress functions,
the button has a double-click function in the three movement
directions:

• Manual, means opening or closing until the button is released.

• Overpress function, means opening or closing using the onetouch control function

• Double-click function, means that the button is pressed twice
within a short time into the overpress position or into the tilt
position. This enables the slide/tilt sunroof to be opened and
closed automatically from any position.

While moving, the slide/tilt sunroof can be stopped by pressing the
button in the opposite direction.

Alarm System (DWA)

The DWA system is standard equipment in the F01 and F02 and
is functionally the same as previous models.
There are a few points to note:

• The ultrasonic interior sensor is entirely integrated in the roof
function center (FZD).

• The emergency power siren and combined tilt sensor is located near the rear wheel arch.

• It is not possible to activate the alarm system when the
Terminal R or Terminal 15 signal is present.

Overview
The anti-theft alarm system is a standard feature. The task of the
anti-theft alarm system is to indicate unauthorized access to the
vehicle by emitting an alarm.

The alarm can be triggered both audibly and visually. To do this,
however, the alarm system must be activated. When activated, the
alarm monitors the whole of the vehicle interior.

In addition the alarm system monitors the engine compartment and
the vehicle's rest position. In order that nothing can be stolen from
the trunk, the alarm system monitors opening of the trunk lid.

The alarm also signals an attempt to tamper with the vehicle, e.g.
cutting of the supply line to the emergency power siren.

The alarm system's ultrasonic interior movement detector is entirely integrated in the roof function center (FZD).
The ultrasonic signal passes into the inside of vehicle through
apertures in the grille of the roof function center. The emergency
power siren and combined tilt sensor is located near the rear wheel
arch.

Activating the Anti-theft Alarm
The anti-theft alarm system is activated when the vehicle is
centrally locked. Activation can be triggered by the following
components:

Explanation
Siren with integrated tilt sensor

• Driver's door lock barrel

Trunk lock with trunk lid switch

• ID transmitter

Door contact, rear driver’s side door

• Outside door handle with Comfort Access (sensitive surface).

Door contact, driver’s door

After the vehicle has been centrally locked, the emergency power
siren is first activated together with the tilt alarm sensor. Then, the
signals from all door switches, the hood switch and the trunk-lid
switch are checked for plausibility.

Footwell Module (FRM)
FZD with integrated USIS

Once the contacts are set, they are then linked to the vehicle monitoring system by the anti-theft alarm system.

Terminal 30

The tilt sensor and the ultrasonic interior movement detector must
be adjusted to the vehicle's situation each time the vehicle is
centrally double-locked. This is called initializing.

Rear power distribution box

The alarm system on the F01/F02 uses an ultrasonic interior
movement detector (USIS) for monitoring the vehicle interior.
The USIS is fully integrated in the FZD.

The tilt alarm sensor delivers information on the vehicle's rest position. If this value is plausible, the tilt alarm sensor is included in the
vehicle monitoring process.

The door switches (6, 7, 11, 12, Hall-effect sensors) are monitored
by the FRM (13). As soon as the status of a Hall-effect sensor
changes, the ultrasonic interior movement detector (14) receives
that information via the K-CAN2. If the DWA system is activated,
an alarm is triggered.

The alarm system's ultrasonic interior movement detector monitors
the passenger compartment. It therefore takes a little time before
the ultrasonic interior movement detector can actively be used for
the anti-theft alarm system. The ultrasonic interior movement
detector is switched to 'activated' approximately 30 seconds after
the contacts have been linked to the alarm system.

The hood switch (1) is monitored by the CAS 4 (2). If the status
changes, an alarm is triggered in the same way. Opening of the
trunk lid is monitored by the JB electronics (4). If the status of the
trunk-lid switch (10) changes, it triggers an alarm.

F01 Workbook - Module 1

Deactivating tilt sensor and ultrasonic interior sensor (USIS)

It is advisable to deactivate the tilt sensor and USIS in the following
situations:
• Vehicle parked on slanted surface

• Vehicle on ship transport

• Vehicle on car transporter

• Persons or animals in vehicle.

Deactivation is performed by centrally double-locking or autoremote closing the vehicle a second time within 10 seconds of
doing so the first time. To acknowledge, the alarm system LED is lit
for 2 seconds.
Deactivating the anti-theft alarm system

The anti-theft alarm system is deactivated by the "unlock" or
"selective unlock" central locking functions. An audible and/or
visual signal can be output in connection with deactivating corresponding to the country specific version.

If an alarm was triggered during the time when the anti-theft alarm
system was activated, the alarm system LED flashes for 5 minutes.
If a terminal status changes, e.g. if the central locking is unlocked,
while the LED is flashing then the LED stops flashing. If the alarm
is deactivated while the alarm is active, the deactivate instruction is
not acknowledged and the alarm signal is completed.
Unlocking the trunk

The tilt alarm sensor and USIS are blanked out if the luggage compartment is unlocked and opened on an armed vehicle. Loading
the vehicle might result in a new vehicle resting position.
Initialization of the USIS and the tilt sensor starts 6 seconds after
the trunk is closed again. When the trunk is closed, the visual
confirmation signal is repeated to indicate to the driver that the
trunk properly closed.

No crosswise operation

If crosswise operation is not implemented, an alarm is triggered
when the anti-theft alarm system is deactivated.

This only applies to activating with the ID transmitter and deactivating via the driver's door lock. The footwell module detects that the
vehicle has been unlocked via the driver's door lock and broadcasts
that information via the K-CAN 2.
The CAS detects that the driver's door lock has been unlocked but
does not unlock the vehicle. The anti-theft alarm system remains
activated and triggers the alarm when the driver's door is opened.
This function is coded on the Car Access System.

Alarm System Feedback
When the alarm is activated, the system does not signal confirmation until all doors, the hood and the trunk have been closed.
That confirmation may be in the form of a visual or audible signal.
If confirmation is by a visual signal, the alarm LED or the hazard
warning lights may flash. If the confirmation signal is audible, it is
produced by sounding the emergency power siren.
Feedback via DWA LED

The DWA LED serves as an indicator showing the status of the
DWA system. The FZD supplies the DWA LED with signals from
the USIS.
When blinking, the DWA LED is driven at a frequency of 0.5 Hz.
The switch-on time is 60 milliseconds. When the DWA LED
flashes, it is activated at a frequency of 2 Hz.

If the vehicle is locked but the trunk is open, it is possible for the ID
transmitter to be inadvertently left in the luggage compartment.
If the trunk lid is closed in such circumstances, it is automatically
opened again to prevent the ID transmitter from being locked in.
In addition to automatically opening the trunk lid, the alarm system
emits an audible warning. The warning consists of the emergency
power siren sounding a two-tone signal three times.
The FRM also activates the visual signal by the hazard warning
lights.

Hazard warning lights flash

Outside Rear View Mirrors

For the F01/F02, there is one version for the outside mirrors.
The outside mirrors feature a LIN bus connection with the following additional functions:
• Outside mirror fold-in

• Electrochromic outside mirrors

Instrument cluster (1) records the outside temperature and makes
this information available to the vehicle electrical system.

In the F01, the footwell module (2) receives the outside temperature from the instrument cluster. The outside mirrors are connected
via the LIN-bus. The footwell therefore requests the mirror heating
function via the LIN-bus.

• Memory function of outside mirror settings

• In combination with the Lane Change Warning, the outside
mirror also contains the LED for the Lane Change Warning
display.

Exterior Lighting System with Adaptive Headlights

The adaptive headlight AHL (with bi-xenon lights) is standard on
the F01/F02. The adaptive headlights include the functions of the
exterior lighting system. However it allows panning of the bi-xenon
low-beam and high-beam headlights when cornering while driving.

Panning of the bi-xenon low-beam and high beam headlights is
adapted continuously during cornering. Illumination during cornering therefore improves the driver's vision.
Illumination during cornering results in:

• Safer cornering with faster identification of obstacles

• Better perception of the environment

• Prevention of accidents.

The electronics of the adaptive headlight allow fast reaction to the
current driving conditions. The system is controlled by the electronics and is less susceptible to malfunctions than purely mechanical systems.

Overview
The functions of the exterior lighting are integrated in the footwell
module. These lighting functions are:
• Side lights (parking lights)
• Low beam headlight

• High-beam headlight
– Headlight flasher

• Fog light

• Direction indicator light

– Hazard warning light

• Tail light/license plate light
• Brake force display

• Reversing light
• Parking lights

• Welcome light

• Delayed switch-off home lights
• Daytime driving light.

The headlight lighting functions are powered via a headlight driver
module or the footwell module.
The footwell module controls a constant brightness level for each
headlight. This is achieved with a pulse-width regulated voltage
supply. Voltage fluctuations in the vehicle electrical and bus systems are compensated for by the pulse width.
The LEDs, e.g. in the additional brake light, tail light or bi-xenon
headlight are not controlled but rather activated at 100%pulse
width.

In addition to the standard light functions, further functions for the
exterior lighting are integrated in the footwell module:
• Dynamic beam throw adjustment system
• Lamp monitoring

– Cold monitoring with lights "OFF"
– Hot monitoring with lights "ON"

• Visual alarm/feedback

– Central locking system, Antitheft alarm system,
Crash signal

• Special case at "Terminal 15 OFF"
• Emergency operating mode
• Adaptive headlight with
– Turning lights

– Adaptive headlight-range adjustment system.

Adaptive Headlight-range Adjustment
The adaptive headlight-range adjustment function is used when
the vehicle is driven through dips and over crests. Through dips,
the headlight range is increased without dazzling oncoming vehicles.

Over crests, the throw of the headlight beam is lowered slightly.
An oncoming vehicle is not dazzled as much it would have been by
standard headlights.

The red line represents the eye line of drivers in oncoming traffic.
The eye line is the imaginary line along which a driver's eyes move
while the vehicle is driven through a dip or over a crest.

The adaptive headlight-range adjustment can be considered similar
to an adaptive cornering headlight, albeit turned through 90°.

Seats

As far as the seating is concerned, the standard front seats on the
F01/F02 are the Multifunction seat (comfort seat).
There is an optional luxury seating package which consists of the
Active seat option in addition to the ventilated seats.

The passenger-assist function is available for the memory seat and
the multifunction seat.

The seat module sends the request via the K-CAN to the function
indicator for the activated passenger-assist function button in order
to switch on the LED in the button.

The seats can be adjusted from KL 30B ON. The seat-adjustment
switch simply has to be pressed in the desired direction. The seats
can have up to eight adjustable positions.

A new feature is the passenger-assist function. This is a new function which enables the driver to adjust the front-passenger seat.
The passenger assist function is also referred to as the “Gentleman
Function”.
Passenger-assist Function
The passenger-assist function is available from terminal 30B ON.
The seat module on the driver's side alone is responsible for the
passenger-assist Function.

The button status is read in by the footwell module via the LIN bus
and sent via the K-CAN2. The central gateway module transfers
the signal to the relevant bus system.
As soon as the driver's seat module SMFA detects an operation
request from the passenger-assist function button, it prepares the
front-passenger seat module for an adjustment request via the
K-CAN.
When the seat adjustment switch on the driver's side is now activated, the seat module on the passenger's side executes the
request.

The K-CAN is used for communication between the seat modules.
This allows all seat adjustment functions for the front-passenger
seat and the memory function to be operated from the driver's
seat.

Massage function in Rear-compartment Comfort Seat
The F01/F02 is the first BMW vehicle to have the rear-compartment massage option.

An electropneumatic system is used to implement the massage
function. The massage function can be activated from terminal
30B ON. The seat module is integrated into the backrest of the
seat concerned and is responsible for the massage function.

In the backrest of the comfort seat, there is a massage pad for the
massage function. Pressing the button starts the massage function at the maximum massage intensity.

Pressing the button again switches it to a lower massage intensity
level. Pressing the button once again switches the massage
function off.

If the button is pressed for longer than 1.2 seconds during the
massage function, the massage function will be switched off.

In order to indicate that the massage function has been activated,
the seat module sends the request to switch on the LEDs in the
button.

The signal terminal 58g ON is made available through the footwell
module. The junction box electronics pass on terminal 58g ON to
the button. The button then switches the back lighting on.

Massage function button

The buttons for the massage function are connected via the LIN
bus to the junction box electronics.
The junction box electronics evaluate the status of the massage
button and send the status via the K-CAN2.
The central gateway module transfers the signal to the K-CAN.
This allows the seat module to receive the current status of the
buttons. The seat module evaluates the status, activates the
massage function, and monitors it.

Massage

The massage function is divided into massage cycles. A massage
cycle consists of the massage and includes back mobilization and
lasts approximately 64 seconds. After this, a new massage cycle
begins.
There are twelve massage cushions that help to relieve tension in
the back muscles through a wave-like motion along the backrest
from top to bottom.

Mobilization

The massage is followed by a mobilization therapy for the back.
The mobilization cushions are simultaneously inflated and deflated
periodically and sectionally. For example, the mobilization cushions
in the right shoulder and right lumbar as well as the mobilization
cushions in the left thorax are pumped up and deflated. Following
that, the opposite side is inflated and deflated.

The wave-type motion is created by inflating and deflating the
massage cushions. The pressure distribution module activates
the massage cushions in pairs simultaneously.

Active Seat Ventilation for the Rear Comfort Seat
In the F01/F02, a new concept has been introduced for the active
seat ventilation. This concept requires only two fans for each seat.

The integrated automatic heating and air conditioning system
provides the vehicle with climate-controlled air. This means there is
sufficient fresh and climate-controlled air in the footwell in front of
the rear seats. The fans draw some air from the footwell. The
drawn-in air is routed via each air-conditioning pad to the seat and
the backrest.

The active seat ventilation relies on the 4-zone automatic air conditioning. The buttons for the active seat ventilation are in the control
panel of the automatic rear-compartment air conditioning.

The air intensity of the active seat ventilation is coupled to the fan
setting of the automatic rear-compartment air conditioning.
This makes it possible to harmonize the fan noises in the rear compartment. The active seat ventilation therefore reaches its
maximum value, when the automatic rear-compartment air conditioning is set to the maximum fan setting.

The seat module in the seat concerned has sole responsibility for
the active seat ventilation function. Stage 3 is engaged when the
button is pressed for the first time. This sets a high fan stage for
seat and backrest.
The next fan setting or OFF is selected on further pressing of the
button.

Air-conditioning Pad
The air-conditioning pad has openings in the area of the seat and
backrest surfaces. Air can be drawn in through the openings in
order to control the temperature of the seat cover.

Special covers are required for active seat ventilation. The covers
have very small air outlets. The air drawn in by the fans can flow
through the air outlets. This cools the seat cover and ensures that
the temperature of the seat cover remains pleasant.

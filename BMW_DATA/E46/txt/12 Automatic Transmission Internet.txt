COMPONENTS
Transmission Cases and Pan:
Made of aluminum alloy, the cases are light weight. The single piece oil pan is made of single wall sheet metal. It includes a drain plug on the bottom surface at the rear .

The oil pan is mounted to the main case by 20 bolts. Oil pan sealing integrity is ensured
by a controlled compression gasket. Cross tightening is required to ensure an even seal.
Final torque of pan bolts is 10-12 Nm.
Torque Converter:
The 4 element torque converter consists of the Turbine, Rotor,
Stator with one way clutch and Lock up clutch. Similar in
function to previous torque converters, this unit’s lock up
clutch is:
•
•
•

Fully disengaged
Variable engagement providing precise slippage,
Fully engaged (locked)

The various clutch application hydraulic pressures are regulated by the control module activated torque converter lock up
solenoid.
The torque converter is manufactured specifically for the
model it is installed in and is part number specific.
6
Automatic Transmissions

Vane Pump:
The A5S 360R uses a vane pump to provide the transmission main line oil supply for operation and cooling requirements. The pump rotor is mechanically driven by the torque converter oil pump drive tangs at 1:1 engine speed rotation providing pump operation.
PIVOT PIN

SLIDE

The rotor with 13 vanes is located in a recess on
the rear surface of the bell housing covered by the
pump cover plate. The rotor and vanes are
placed inside a slide mechanism. As the rotor
spins, the vanes “sweep” the oil from the pump
intake to the output along the mating surface of
the vane ends and the interior surface of the slide.
The slide is mounted on a pivot pin. As it pivots, it
changes the eccentricity of the rotor to slide mating
surface changing the pump output volume.

ROTOR &
VANES

CALIBRATED SPRING

The slide’s position is influenced by a calibrated
spring and hydraulic input pressure from the main
pressure regulator solenoid in the valve body.

The benefit of changing the slide position is to optimize pump output volume to meet the
needs of the operating conditions.
•

Max volume during
engine startup. This
condition provides a
fast priming action
of the pump for
immediate lubrication and hydraulic
pressure for operation.

•

Regulated output
volume for varied
driving conditions.
Maximum volume is
not required at all
times.

The GS 20 regulates the pump output volume as well as main line pressure regulation

Automatic Transmissions

Electro/Hydraulic Valve Body:
Located in the oil sump, the valve body is the electro/hydraulic control center for regulating
and distributing pressurized transmission fluid for activating the various clutches, torque
converter variable lock up, and regulation of main line oil pressures.
Sub components of the valve body assembly include:
•

Manual valve

•

One main pressure regulator solenoid (Pressure Regulator Force Motor Solenoid - "GM
term")

•

One torque converter regulator solenoid (also serves the Reverse Lock out function)

•

Three MV shift solenoids (When activated in a coded sequence provide shifts for 1-2,23,3-4,4-5)

•

The spool valves and springs for controlling apply pressures, activating shifts, regulating torque converter lock up, etc.

•

Four accumulator chambers for "cushioning" the transmission fluid apply pressure during upshifts 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5.

Accumulator Chambers:
The accumulator chambers are similar in function to "fluid dampers". The accumulators are
used to improve shift quality by absorbing apply pressures on the multiplate clutches providing a cushioned clutch engagement.

Clutch apply fluid pressure
directed to an accumulator
piston and helped by a
spring force opposes an
accumulator fluid line pressure creating an action
similar
to
a
shock
absorber.

Once the clearance between the clutch plates is taken up by the piston travel and the
plates begin complete engagement the fluid pressure builds very rapidly.
The accumulator is connected to the clutch
apply circuit which at this
point starts to absorb the LINE PRESSURE
FROM OIL PUMP
rapidly building pressure.

Transmission Fluid Heat Exchanger:
A transmission fluid heat exchanger is
located on the bottom edge of the radiator.
Transmission fluid inlet and outlet hose
fittings are located on the driver’s side of
the transmission.
The heat exchanger provides two functions:

•

After initial start up, the transmission
fluid is warmed up by the engine
coolant as it passes through the heat
exchanger. The heat exchanger is
controlled by an integral thermostat
which regulates the transmission fluid
flow into the radiator exchanger. In
this state the heat exchanger acts as
a transmission oil heater.

•

During operation at higher temperatures, the hot transmission fluid loses heat to the
engine coolant when it passes through the heat exchanger and into the core of the radiator.

14
Automatic Transmissions

A5S 360R POWER FLOW
The GS 20 module controls the hydraulic valve body through electrical activation of the various solenoids. Electrical activation is based on a programmed operation map and transmission operating conditions (vehicle speed, engine load, throttle position, range selection,
AGS program logic, etc).
Engine torque is transferred by the various drive clutches when activated. The various
torque paths enter the planetary gearset as input. Simultaneously, the planetary gearset
is provided with reactionary input (held components) from the various brake clutches and
Free Wheel clutches.
The output result is five forward drive gears with progressive ratios and a single reverse
gear.

GS 20 INPUT SIGNALS
Power Supply and Grounds:
The GS 20 receives:
•
•
•
•

KL 30 (constant battery power),
KL 15 (terminal 15 of the ignition switch)
KL 87 (operating power from the Engine Control Main Relay)
KL 31 (ground connection for the control module electronics and peripheral component
operation)

The GS 20 monitors the power/ground inputs for shorts (B+ and B-), open circuits and battery voltage levels (high and low).

Range Selector Switch:
The switch is mounted inside the transmission main case on the driver’s side. This location provides precise monitoring of the Manual
valve position and is sheltered from the harsh environment under the
vehicle external of the main case. Adjustment is not required.
The range selector switch has 6 wires. The GS 20 provides the switch with 12 volts on one
wire (pin 2 of connector X70004).
X70004

Depending on the range selector posi- Park
tion, the switch provides coded high Reverse
signals over five wires to the GS 20. Neutral

Electronic Brake and Brake Test Switch:
The GS 20 monitors the brake pedal position to activate sport mode, down hill recognition
and for the shift lock operation. The control module receives both the brake and brake test
hall effect sensor signals. When pressed;
· the brake light switch pulls a standing voltage in the GS 20 low,
· the brake test switch provides a high signal to a circuit monitor in the GS 20.
18
Automatic Transmissions

Kick Down Switch:
When the throttle pedal is pressed fully to
the floor, the kick down switch closes providing a ground signal to the GS 20.
The GS 20 recognizes the ground as a
request to provide an immediate down shift
and to switch to the AGS sport mode shifting program.
Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor:
Located in the transmission oil sump, the NTC oil temperature sensor’s
ohmic value decreases as the temperature increases. The GS 20 monitors
the fluid temperature by sensing the voltage drop across the sensor causing a standing monitor voltage to "bleed" to ground. Rise and fall of the
standing voltage value is a direct correlation of the fluid temperature.
Detection of high fluid temperature modifies the torque converter regulation control and
modifies the shift program to aid in reducing transmission fluid temperature.
If the signal becomes impaired, the GS 20 applies a substitute temperature value based on
Engine Temperature via CAN and stores a specific fault code.
Transmission Input and Output Speed Sensors:
The transmission speed sensors (turbine and output shaft) are analog inductive sensors that produce an AC sine wave similar to an ABS/ASC wheel
speed sensor. The AC signal frequency is proportional to the rotation speed
of the monitored components .
•

The turbine speed sensor scans a pulse wheel attached to the forward clutch housing.

•

The output shaft speed sensor scans a pulse wheel attached to the rear ring gear.

The GS 20 monitors these signals along with the engine speed signal (CAN) to calculate
transmission slip ratio for plausibility and for the adaptive pressure control function.
The sensors are monitored for plausible signals, opens and shorts. Specific fault codes are
stored for defects with these sensors.

GS 20 OUTPUT CONTROL SIGNALS
Valve Body Solenoid and Pressure Regulator Control
The GS 20 activates the 3 shift solenoids by individual switched
ground output control signals.
The Main Oil Pressure and Torque Converter Lock up regulators are
controlled by a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) control to ground.
PWM control modulates the hydraulic control pressures based on the
current AGS shift program and maintains adaptive pressure control.
Shift Lock Solenoid Control:
The shift lock feature prevents the unintentional movement of the shifter from Park or
Neutral.
When KL 15 is switched on, the shift lock is
engaged, when the brake pedal is pressed,
the GS 20 releases the ground control circuit of the shift lock solenoid unlocking the
shift gate. Additionally, above 2500 RPM,
the selector lever remains locked in Park
even if the brake pedal is applied.
P/N Signal:
As an output function, the GS 20 provides the EWS 3.3 with a switched high/low signal for
P/N status.
•
•

P or N = high
all other ranges = low.

The EWS 3.3 provides the P/N safety feature preventing the starter motor from operating
unless the shifter is in P/N (high signal).
Back Up Light Relay Control:
As an output function, the GS 20 provides a switched ground to activate the control circuit
of the back up light relay when the range selector is in R. The Back Up Light Relay provides power directly to the back up lights. The lighting circuit is also used as a high signal
indicating Reverse status for PDC, NAV and the electro chromatic rearview mirror systems.

Automatic Transmissions

CAN BUS COMMUNICATION:
The E46 utilizes the now familiar “twisted pair” CAN bus wiring configuration for drivetrain
and instrument cluster communication interface. The MS 42.0 to GS 20 link is a dedicated CAN circuit. The MS 42.0 is the gateway for data exchange between the GS 20 and
Mark 20 EI (traction control) and the Instrument cluster.

GS 20 Program Features Overview
AGS (ADAPTIVE TRANSMISSION CONTROL)
The GS 20 adaptive transmission control feature automatically selects suitable shifting programs based on driving style, selected range, monitored signal activity and road/environmental conditions. Advantages to the AGS shift control include:
•
•
•
•

Shift points adapted to the driving style
Improved safety - no unwanted up shifting while in a tight curve,
Automatic determination and selection of the winter program for better driveaway traction and reduced shift activity.
Improved comfort - Starting in second gear in stop and go traffic.

The AGS can be divided into two functional groups:
1. Driver influenced features
2. Features that react automatically to the driving style and environmental conditions.
DRIVER INFLUENCED FEATURES OF AGS
The adaptive drive program is based primarily on throttle input from the MS 42.0 control
module via the CAN bus. The calculated rate of pedal position change influences the selection of the shift points.
Moderate movement
causes moderate
downshifts while a
quick application of
the throttle initiates a
downshift.
The GS 20 also
monitors braking
and kickdown
request.
Economical driving: Shifter in D. Drive with slow application of throttle. This provides low
and comfortable shift points providing high fuel efficiency.
Quick accelerator pedal activity automatically leads the GS 20 into the intermediate power
mode. Based on this input data, the AGS automatically selects a sporty shift strategy.
Sport: Shifter in "D", shift points are higher to take advantage of the full engine performance. The sport program is also immediately activated by a kick down request or excessive braking.
22
Automatic Transmissions

The AGS driving programs are not adapted on a long term basis - nor is it stored
in the GS 20 control module memory when the ignition key is switched off.
The GS 20 continuously monitors the driving style and adapts to meet the current
driver requirements.
AGS FEATURES THAT REACT TO OPERATING CONDITIONS
Stop and Go Driving: This feature is activated by a defined sequence of shifts which are
as follows:
•

Upshift from first to second - followed by a downshift from second to first - followed by
another upshift from first to second. This is then followed by the vehicle coming to a
complete stop.

After this sequence, the transmission will stay in second gear. The GS 20 AGS program
has recognized stop and go driving and this function prevents excessive shifting during
heavy traffic conditions. The second gear start is cancelled when:
•
•

The throttle pedal movement exceeds limits (quick step on the pedal)
The range selector is moved to P, N or R.

Curve Recognition: This feature is activated when the GS 20 detects a variation of front
wheel speeds via the CAN bus. The Mark 20 EI control module broadcasts the wheel
speed sensor signals and their speed variations for any control module programmed to
monitor this condition. When curves are recognized, the GS 20 inhibits up shifting until the
front wheel speed signals equalize indicating the vehicle is driving straight ahead. This feature enhances the vehicle handling characteristics when cornering at higher speeds.
Winter Drive Program: Wheel slip is calculated by the GS 20 based on wheel rotation
data provided by the traction control system via CAN bus. The GS 20 modifies shift characteristics to match winter mode for better traction. When active, the transmission will
start in second gear and the shift points are lowered. The purpose of this program is to
improve the drivability of the vehicle with slippery road conditions.
Cruise Control Program: When cruise control is activated, the MS 42.0 control module
communicates this status via the CAN bus. The GS 20 activates a program suitable for
active cruise control operation preventing pendulum locking/unlocking of the torque converter and minimizes up/down shifting. Additionally, the MS 42.0 can request a downshift if
the vehicle speed exceeds the set speed limit when coasting downhill.
Hill Recognition Program: The GS 20 activates this feature when it detects a high engine
load condition at lower road speeds. When the vehicle is traveling up hill the shift points
are raised to prevent repetitive up/down shifting.
23
Automatic Transmissions

NON AGS FUNCTIONS
The following features are part of the GS 20 automatic control system - but not AGS specific control features.
Manually Selected Extra Sport Program: Longer delay shift pattern with higher engine
RPM. This program is similar to the AGS detected sport program but requires the driver to
move the range selector from D to 4th gear or lower.
This program automatically returns to AGS shift program selection when the shifter is
returned to the D position.
Engine Warm Up Cycle: Based on the detected engine coolant temperature (CAN), the
shift points are raised during cold engine operation. This is implemented to speed up the
warm up cycle of the catalytic converter.
Downshift protection: If the driver moves the range selector to a lower gear at higher
vehicle speeds, the GS 20 delays the down shift until the road speed drops below a programmed value. This feature protects the powertrain from unnecessary loads ensuring long
life operation.

24
Automatic Transmissions

ADAPTIVE HYDRAULIC PRESSURE CONTROL:
The GS 20 monitors engine speed via the CAN bus along with the transmission input and
output speed signals simultaneously to determine the slip ratio and slip time during a shift.
Slip ratio and slip time are influenced by production related differences between transmissions and by aging.
The comparison of target & real slip allow the GS 20 to perform the adaptive pressure control function by modifying the PWM control of the main pressure regulator solenoid increasing the clutch apply pressures to compensate for internal slip. The adaptive pressure control function optimizes the shift quality and increases the life span of the clutch plates.
The adaptive pressure control feature is not an AGS function.
Clearing adaptation values with the DIS or
MoDiC only clears this pressure control
adaptation values. Clearing these values
can lead to bad shift quality until the shift
pressure is again optimized by the adaptation.

25
Automatic Transmisions

EMERGENCY PROGRAM (SAFETY MODE)
If a malfunction causes the GS 20 to activate the Emergency Program, the
transmission fault indicator and the Check Engine Light in the instrument cluster
both illuminate (CAN signal activation) and electronic control terminates.
The transmission shifts manually in the following sequence:
•
•
•

For range selector lever positions D, 4, 3 or 2, Fifth gear is immediately activated (no
electrical control). P, R and N positions operate normally.
Torque converter lock up clutch is not functional
Reverse lock out is also not functional.

If the vehicle is stopped and restarted with this condition, the vehicle drives normally until
the condition that initially caused the Emergency Program activation is once again detected.
If the initial problem was a power down of the GS 20 control module, the transmission will
shift manually in the following sequence:
•
•
•

For range selector lever position D, 4, 3 or 2, Fourth gear is immediately selected. P, R
and N positions operate normally.
Torque converter lock up clutch is not functional
Reverse lock out is also not functional.

GS 20 PROGRAMMING:
The control module must be programmed to update resident program data in an existing
or after replacing a defective GS 20 control module. As with previous systems, the fault
memory must be cleared and the system fully functional.
Connect a battery charger to the vehicle prior to programming to ensure adequate voltage
supply during the programming procedure. When programming is completed, clear the
system adaptation values using the DIS or MoDiC.
Always make sure the programming software is the latest version.

31

BASIC TROUBLESHOOTING
• Always personally verify the customer complaint.
•

Always verify that the complaint is truly a system malfunction.

• Perform a Quick Test to determine if the vehicle systems have logged fault codes.
•

Call up the faulted system or appropriate test schedule to verify the correct control
module is installed in the car.

•

Follow the Diagnostic Information System (DIS) on screen instructions and perform all
tests as specified.

•

Use the DIS and fault symptom diagnostic procedures as trained.

•

Follow the appropriate test module procedures for systems that malfunction but fail to
set faults in memory.

•

To get a thorough understanding of automatic transmission issues, a GM or ZF
Technical Specialist must be contacted whenever a vehicle is brought into the workshop
with an automatic transmission related concern. Always have the printouts of fault
codes stored in the DME and EGS and the transmission serial number available when
calling.

•

If there is no Service Information Bullitin published which addresses the specific
complaint, do not make any repairs to a 5 speed automatic transmission prior to
contacting a GM or ZF Technical Specialist. Contacts may be made by calling the
BMW Technical Hotline: 1-800 472-7222

Converter
clutch

As in all automatic transmissions, power is transmitted via
the torque converter with converter clutch and via the drive
and brake clutches to the planetary gear and on to the
output flange.
The basic functions of the torque converter and the torque
converter clutch are described in the training manual "BMW
Automatic Transmission: Design and Function".
The features in which the torque converter and torque
converter clutch differ from the A5S310Z are as follows.
- The weight of the torque converter has been reduced and
the converter clutch has no torsion dampers, so the mass
moment of inertia has been optimised.
- No torsion damper in the torque converter clutch, further
optimising the mass moment of inertia.
- This transmission permits oil flow to continue when the
torque converter clutch closed. This reduces the oil
temperature in the torque converter.
The torque converter clutch linings have small ducts to
permit this flow of oil.
- The torque converter clutch is closed in third, fourth and
fifth gears. As in the A5S440Z, clutch closure is slipcontrolled.
Control is in the speed range from approximately
25 km/h to approximately 120 km/h, depending on the
load situation. The torque converter clutch is always
closed at speeds in excess of 120 km/h.
- The torque converter clutch for the 2.8 litre has two
linings (as in the A5S440Z). The version for 2.5 litre and
2.0 litre models has only one lining. This lining is on the
torque converter housing, not (as in the A5S310Z) on the
clutch.

1.3

Oil pump

The basic clutch functions are described in the training
manual "BMW Automatic Transmission: Design
and Function".
The delivery rate of the oil pump has been increased from
16 cm per revolution to 24 cm per revolution. This higher
delivery rate means that a controlled converter clutch can
be used.
The pump draws in oil via a filter and discharges the pressurized oil via a flow control valve which returns excess oil
not needed at high engine speeds to the pump intake side.
The flow control valve directs the pressurized oil via the
main pressure valve in the hydraulic shift unit. This valve
regulates the oil pressure and returns excess oil to the
intake duct, releasing energy to increase pressure on the
intake side in the same way as the flow control valve. This
increase in pressure prevents cavitation and reduces noise.

Clutches

The basic clutch functions are described in the training
manual "BMW Automatic Transmission: Design
and Function".
The ring-type multi-disc clutches A-B-E and F are drive
clutches which transmit engine power to the planetary gear
set. Clutches C-D and G are brake clutches which brace the
torque against the transmission case.
Shifts from first to second gear are assisted by a freewheel.
In these shifts, therefore, there is no clutch overlap.
Shifts from second to third, from third to fourth and from
fourth to fifth are overlap shifts. This means that one clutch
must continue to transmit drive at reduced main pressure
until the other clutch engages.
The transmission dispenses with brake bands, which has
led to improved shift quality.

Tolerance limits for the dished-spring forces were reduced
for all clutches, so fill-pressure tolerance is down. The gap
is now set by the snap ring so fill volume tolerances are
narrower. The increase in wear reserves boosts operational
dependability and transmission durability.

Planetary
gear set

The basic functions of the planetary gear set are described
in the training manual "BMW Automatic Transmission:
Design and Function".
As in the A5S310Z, the A5S325Z transmission uses a
Ravigneau planetary gear set.
The bearings of the planetary gears have been improved in
this transmission (e.g. double bearings for short planet
gears and cage bearings for long planet gears). These
design modifications reduce gear noise and improve driving
characteristics.
Tail planetary gear set
The tail planetary gear set consists of a sun gear with its
four planet gears, a planet spider and a ring gear.

The basic functions of the electronic-hydraulic control
system are described in the training manual
"BMW Automatic Transmission: Design and Function".

Hydraulic shift unit

The A5S325Z has three solenoid valves and four electrical
pressure control valves to control the shift unit. Two of the
pressure control valves are for gear shifts. One controls the
modulation pressure and one operates the torque converter
clutch. Controlled converter clutch operation would not be
possible without a pressure control valve.

Automatic Transmissions

1.12 Electronic
control unit

A new control unit is used for A5S325Z transmissions. This
control unit has also been fitted to A5S440Z transmissions
since model year '98. The new control unit has a modular
plug-in system with five chambers. Not all the plug modules
are used in the automatic transmission control unit. The
ground connections in module 1 are longer. This ensures
that these pins are the first to make contact when the plug
is pushed onto the control unit.

Pins not used

These new high-end standard control units have shorter
access times on account of a new, more powerful 32-bit
processor with 256 k memory and a program run time of
approx. 10 ms. The old control units had an 8-bit processor
with 64 k memory and a run time of approx. 24 ms.
The new control units exclude the possibility of skip downshifts, for example from fifth to third. Downshifts can only be
sequential through the gears.
The control units optimise shift quality. The transmission
reacts faster to load changes when, for example, the driver
allows the car to coast and then immediately presses the
accelerator pedal to the floor. Under these conditions, the
A5S310Z transmission shifted up a gear and then shifted
back down. The A5S325Z transmission cancels the upshift,
so the transmission remains in the original gear. Shift
transition control, too, has been improved, and clutch
draining and filling are better matched. These measures
have considerably enhanced levels of shift comfort.

1.13 Registering
turbine speed

A Hall sensor (1) registers turbine speed (spider speed) in
the A5S325Z transmission. The magnetic pole wheel (3) at
cylinder A (4) rotates at turbine speed and generates a pulse
frequency. This pulse frequency is registered by the Hall
sensor through the non-magnetic bowl (2).
This innovation enables speed to be measured much more
accurately than was the case with the A5S310Z transmission.
Synchronisation, in turn, can be calculated to a much finer
degree of precision. Shift quality benefits accordingly.

1.14 Programming

Flashcode programming is the same as that used for the
GS 8.55 control unit for the A5S440Z automatic transmission. The programming procedure is largely an adaptation of digital engine management programming with
features tailored to electronic transmission control. As in
digital engine management, flashcode control units can be
programmed 14 times.
Note:

The adaptation values always have to be
deleted once the electronic transmission
control unit has been programmed. The control
unit has to re-adapt after the adaptation values
have been deleted. The control unit adapts
automatically when the car is on the road.
It is, however, advisable to perform a test run
covering upshifts and downshifts through all
the gears.
The CAN bus is interrupted during programming, with the result that a CAN error
is stored in the control units connected
(ABS/ASC, DME etc.). Programming should
always be followed by diagnosis to clear
the fault memories of all the control units
connected to the CAN bus.

1.15 Modifications
to adaptive
transmission
control

How adaptive transmission control for A5S325Z transmissions differs from the implementation for A5S310Z
transmissions.

The basic function of adaptive transmission control is
described in the training manual "Adaptive transmission
control unit".

Adaptive transmission control is the same as that implemented for the A5S440Z transmission. This transmission,
therefore, has two adaptation modes for the A and S programs.

A program
Basic shift characteristic XE and shift characteristic E
are selected in the A program.
It is not possible to switch to the S or XS shift
characteristics.

S program
Basic shift characteristic S and performance-oriented
shift characteristic XS are selected in the S program.
It is not possible to switch to the XE or E shift
characteristics.

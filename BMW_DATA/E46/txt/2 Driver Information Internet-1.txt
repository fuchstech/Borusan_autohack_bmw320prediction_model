Introduction
The driver information system is presented to the driver in two main areas, the instrument
cluster and the center console area. The E46 makes extensive use of bussing for communication between control modules and reduction in wiring.
The instrument cluster in the E46 is similar in design to the basic cluster installed in the E39.
It uses the pictogram display block for check control and lamp failure warnings.

The Bus links used in the E46 include:
The K-Bus: For communication between all body modules and driver information systems.
The CAN Bus: For communication between the engine management control modules and
the instrument cluster.
The D-Bus: For diagnostic communication between the vehicle and the DIS and MoDiC
testers.

E46iC BUS SYSTEM
The Bus system of the E46iC continues to use the K-Bus as the main communication link
between body and driver information modules. The Convertible Top Module (CVM) is added
to the K-Bus for communication with the GM V for top operation and the Instrument Cluster
for diagnostic purposes. The addition of memory functions for both outside mirrors has
required memory modules to control the operation. These modules are also connected to
the K-Bus for communication with the Seat Memory module.
As with other MRS III systems, the MRS module is now connected to the K-Bus for coding/diagnostic and communication with the other control modules.

E46 Driver Information

CHECK CONTROL LCD MATRIX DISPLAY
The pictogram check control display carries over from the E39 for failure display warnings
of various lights, doors/trunk open and low fluid indications. Inputs for warning lamp indication are processed by the cluster electronics and the appropriate LED is illuminated.

RANGE/PROGRAM MATRIX DISPLAY
The right LCD matrix is used to display the driving range and program on vehicles equipped
with an automatic transmission. The transmission fault display is also integrated into the
display matrix. The gear with the explanation point will illuminate when the electronic control of the transmission detects a fault.

8
E46 Driver information

DYNAMIC DIGITAL INPUTS
DISTANCE SIGNAL- This input is supplied to the cluster by the ABS/ASC+T control module as a square wave signal. Pulses from the left rear wheel speed sensor are processed
by the ABS module to produce this signal. The cluster electronics process the input for the
cluster display and pass the signal along, on the K bus, as speed signal “A” for other control modules requiring the vehicle speed signal.
CAN BUS SIGNALS- The “Ti” , engine temperature and “TD” signals are produced by
the DME control module and sent to the cluster. The cluster also passes the TD signal
out over the K Bus.
TRANSMISSION DATA- The AGS control module provides the range selector position,
driving program and fault lamp activation signals to the cluster over the CAN line.

DSC

CAN

OIL TEMPERATURE - This input is a pulse width modulated signal from the Electronic Oil
Level Sensor. As oil level decreases the pulse width of the signal increases. If the signal
shows an oil level that is too low over a period of time, the instrument cluster will illuminate
the Oil Warning indicator LED in yellow.
DIMMER SIGNAL - This is a pulse-width modulated signal from the LSZ. It is used to control the intensity of the back lighting of the instruments and the LCDs when the lights are
switched ON. This signal is also output over the “K” Bus.
K-BUS SIGNALLING - The Cluster receives signals for the Check Control Pictogram over
the K-Bus.
9
E46 Driver Information

ANALOG INPUT SIGNALS
BATTERY VOLTAGE - Battery voltage is monitored by the cluster and a fault is stored if
the voltage exceeds 16 volts
FUEL TANK LEVEL - Two lever action sensors are wired in parallel to the cluster. The two
varying voltage signals are processed by the cluster for fuel gauge and low fuel warning
display.

OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE SENSOR - A NTC sensor is used to measure the ambient
temperature. The signal is processed by the cluster and passed out over the K Bus to modules requiring this input for processing.

10
E46 Driver information

DIGITAL INPUT SIGNALS
The normal ignition switch terminals (KL R, KL 15 & KL 50) are input to the cluster. Various
functions are dependent on ignition switch position.
STEERING COLUMN SWITCH - As with previous systems the turn signal stalk is used to
call up BC functions.
BRAKE PAD WEAR SENSORS - The pad sensor inputs are used to illuminate the brake
pad warning indicator as in the past.

INSTRUMENT PANEL BUTTON - The reset button is used to reset the trip - odometer
as in the past. It will also display the mileage, if pressed with the key switched OFF. This
button is also used for the Base BC/instrument cluster test functions outlined on page 15.
INPUTS FOR WARNING LAMPS - Various switches are used to signal the cluster for
warning and indicator lamp illumination including:
WARNINGS FOR CONVERTIBLES
• The seat belt warning lamp is illuminated when the seat belt is not fastened and
FLASHES when the front seat back is not locked into position.
• The Roll over Protection System warning lamp is illuminated when there is a fault in the
RPS system.
11
E46 Driver Information

OUTPUT SIGNALS
SPEED SIGNAL “A” - The vehicle speed signal is available as an output for control modules that require precise vehicle speed information.
“K” BUS INTERFACE - The K Bus is used to transfer data between the cluster and other
modules on the link. The diagnostic interface also passes over the K Bus for troubleshooting with the DIS Tester.
LOW FUEL - Based on the processing for the low fuel indicator lamp, this output is also
sent to the DME control module. The signal is stored along with a mis-fire detection fault
for troubleshooting purposes.
GONG OUTPUT - T3, The T3 tone is used for check control warnings.

MANIPULATION DOT

The data is compared each time KL 15 is switched on. If the data does not match, the
manipulation dot in the mileage display block will be illuminated.
The following points must be noted with regards to the redundant storage of this data.
1. If the vehicle ID number is not the same in both modules, the manipulation dot is illuminated. All functions of both modules continue to operate.
2. Data will only be transferred from the LSZ to the cluster if the ID numbers match and the
cluster mileage is zero.
3. The VIN is entered in the cluster through coding and will only be accepted when the cluster mileage is zero.
4. The stored mileage in the LSZ can only be overwritten by a higher mileage.
5. If the two mileage values stored vary by more than 120, and the VINs are the same, the
cluster will continue to accumulate mileage and a fault will be stored in the cluster for
data transfer.
6. If the K-Bus link fails, the cluster will continue to store mileage and set a fault for the Bus
link.
New components should only be installed for replacement purposes and not for use as test
components for diagnosis as miles will accumulate if the vehicle is driven for road testing
purposes.

15
E46 Driver Information

Principle of Operation
Starting with the E46 a new method for displaying
the Service Interval is used. Colored LEDs are no
longer used to display the amount of time until the
next service or inspection is due.
With the SIA IV system, the actual mileage remaining until the next service will be displayed for five
seconds when the ignition is first switched on.

OILSERVICE

15000

Miles

The text “OIL SERVICE” or “INSPECTION” will also illuminate to show which service is due.
A minus symbol( - ) before the mileage display indicates that a service is past due.
The calculation process for determining the service interval is similar to SIA III. A set
volume is stored in the Cluster. The processor receives the ti signal from DME as the vehicle is driven. The Cluster also receives the vehicle speed signal from the ASC/DSC control
module.
Based on the amount of fuel consumed and the distance traveled, the processor calculates
the distance remaining to the next service.

Workshop Hints
Reset of the SIA can be done using special tool 62 1 110 if the vehicle is equipped with the
20 pin under-hood diagnosis connector.
On 2001 MY vehicles onward without the diagnostic connector in the engine compartment,
the use of the S.I reset tool is not possible. The Service Indicator may be reset using the
Reset Mode in the Instrument Cluster or with Diagnosis.

COMPONENT OPERATION
The LSZ control module receives inputs from the following switches:
Headlight/parking light switch, fog light switch, potentiometer and photo-transistor mounted in the LSZ switch assembly.
• These inputs are received directly from the LSZ switch assembly.

TURN SIGNAL/HIGHBEAM SWITCH
• The turn signal and headlight (high/low) beam are resistance coded inputs over two wires
to the LSZ control module. The LSZ carries out the switching function based on the voltage drop input.

HAZARD WARNING SWITCH
• The hazard switch provides a ground input to the LSZ to control the operation of the hazard warning lights.
• The hazard warning lights will be switched on in the event of an accident from the crash
sensor input provided by the MRS control module.

BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH
• The brake light switch is a hall sensor that receives power when KL R is switched on. The
switch is low until the brake pedal is pressed. When the LSZ receives a high signal from
the switch the brake lights are switched on.
• If the hall sensor fails, the brake lights will be switched on continuously.

E46 Driver Information

E46 Convertible Third Brake light
The E46iC uses Neon technology for the third brake light which is mounted in the trunk lid.
The remainder of the exterior lighting circuits carry over from the E46 Sedan and
Coupes.The Electronic brake light switch is the input to the LSZ for brake light activation.
The LSZ, as an output, provides power to the Neon light module for activation of the light.
The light module consists of the ignitor, and Neon tube.
The use of neon lighting provides several advantages
to automobile manufacturers and consumers:
Light failures caused by shock and vibration are minimized,
because neon operates without a filament.
The average life of the light is considerably higher as
compared to incandescent bulbs.
Styling of the light includes a more uniform distribution of
light across the lens, and neon tubes can be bent to
conform to the contour of the vehicle.
Amber neon allows the use of a clear lens (for vehicle color
schemes).
Neon enhances safety because of the extremely fast ignition time of the light (instantaneous braking signal), allowing
other drivers more time to react.

Neon Technology
Neon (symbol Ne) produces a glow in
a vacuum electric-discharge tube and is used extensively in the familiar advertising displays.

A neon light is a glass bulb or tube containing neon (gaseous element) at low pressure,
and two metallic electrodes. To make a neon light, the tube is bent while warmed, to the
desired shape and sealed at both ends. During the sealing process, electrodes are added
at each end. An access port is left near one end and a vacuum is applied to the interior
of the tube. After the air and humidity has been removed, the neon gas is added under
low pressure and the tube is sealed.
The light produces a reddish-orange glow when an electric current (applied across the
electrodes) is raised in voltage to the point at which it ionizes the gas in the tube. The
voltage at which the light glows varies with the design of the tube. When the glass tube is
ionized, the voltage drop across the tube is constant, regardless of the amount of current
flowing through the tube. The neon glows with an even intensity throughout the length of
the tube.
A variant of this is the glass tube containing ionized neon at very low pressure. The tube
shines with a brilliant red glow if a high-voltage alternating current is applied to the electrodes sealed in the ends of the tube.

LAMP MONITORING
Lamp monitoring on the E46 is a function of the LSZ control module. The following lamps
are monitored in both the hot and cold states:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

High/low beams
Brake lights - left/right
Turn signal lights
Tail lights
Parking lights
Side marker lights
License plate lights

Hot monitoring takes place when the lights are switched by monitoring the current flow
through the lamp filaments.
Cold monitoring takes place by the LSZ when the lights are switched off. The LSZ will briefly
activate the lighting circuits and check for current flow through the lamps. The lights are not
switched on long enough to illuminate the bulbs.
If the LSZ detects a defective bulb, a signal is sent to the instrument cluster and the warning is posted in the Check Control pictogram.

HOME LIGHTING
This convenience feature provides lighting for the driver and passengers to leave the vehicle and enter their house.
The feature is switched on by activating the headlight flasher switch after the lights and ignition are switched off.

The feature is switched off after the coded time delay or by switching the ignition switch on.

REDUNDANT STORAGE
The LSZ serves as the redundant storage module in parallel with the instrument cluster.
This includes all data used for vehicle identification which is encoded on the assembly line.
In addition the total mileage and SI data are also stored in the LSZ.
If either the Cluster or LSZ has to be replaced, the data is taken from the remaining module and transferred to the replacement unit. This can only occur ONCE the VIN has been
entered into the replacement unit. Once the VIN is entered, the module becomes part of
the vehicle and can not be interchanged with another vehicle.

28
E46 Driver information

EMERGENCY (FAIL SAFE) LIGHTING
The LSZ provides emergency lighting in the event of a control module failure. If the processor of the LSZ control module fails, back up hardware will allow the following lighting circuits to function:
•
•
•
•

Low Beam headlights
Tail lights
Parking Lights
Brake Lights

The headlights and tail lights will come on as soon as KL 15 is switched on, the brake will
operate when the brake pedal is pressed.

XENON HEADLIGHTS
OVERVIEW
The automotive industry/press often identify xenon lighting systems as HID (high intensity
discharge) systems. Xenon headlight technology was first introduced to the US market
exclusively on the E32 750iL in 1993. BMW xenon headlight systems have evolved and
their availability as optional equipment has spread throughout the model lineup.
Blue/White in color and using ellipsoidal technology Xenon headlights provide improved
night time visibility in all driving conditions compared with traditional Halogen bulb headlights.
BENEFITS:
Xenon headlights provide the following benefits:
•

Longer bulb life. Typically, xenon bulbs will last from 3 to 5 times longer than halogen.

•

More light output. Xenon headlights produce from 2.5 to 3 times more lumens than
halogen.

•

Blue/White light (simulates natural daylight). Xenon bulbs produce a blue/white light
while halogen bulbs produce a yellow light. The light color of a light source is measured
in color temperature (not to be confused with thermal temperature). Color temperature
is measured in Kelvins (K). The higher the color temperature the whiter the light.
Natural daylight = 4,500 to 5,000 K
Xenon headlights = 4,000 to 4,500 K
Halogen headlights = 3,200 K (yellow in color)

•

Better driving visibility.
The combination of higher
lumens and higher color
temperature provide a superior lighting source.
The beam is wider and
brighter in front of the vehicle than conventional halogen bulbs improving safety
and driver comfort.

VERSION IDENTIFICATION & SYSTEM SUMMARIES
Version identification is specific to vehicle model with the exception of the E38.
There are two E38 Xenon systems. The early system identified as Generation 2.1 and equipped on
95-98 model year 750iL vehicles. The headlight
design of this version has a flat bottom edge.
The Generation 3 system has been introduced on
1999 model year E38 vehicles. This system can be
visually identified by the rounded bottom edge of
the headlight assembly.

E46 Headlight

LWR: All 1999 model year systems are also equipped with LWR (Headlight Beam Throw
Control). This system automatically adjusts the vertical position of the headlight beams to
compensate for vehicle loads ensuring optimum beam throw. LWR components and function is described further on in this section.
Headlight Replacement Parts: In previous model years, individual replacement parts
were not available for headlight assemblies. This was due to the Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards (FMVSS) relating to pitting or corrosion of the reflector components in
non-sealed beam light assemblies.
BMW has submitted corrosion test data for headlight replacement components which have
passed the FMVSS providing availability of headlight assembly spare parts. The approval
has been given for all Bosch headlight assemblies (including halogen systems).

XENON HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE BULBS
Xenon bulbs are identified as D-2S (D=Discharge).
Xenon bulbs illuminate when an arc of electrical current is established between two electrodes in the bulb.
The xenon gas sealed in the bulb reacts to the electrical excitation and heat generated by the current flow.
The distinct bluish/white brilliant light is the result of the
xenon gas reacting to the controlled current flow.
Phases of Bulb Operation:
Starting Phase: The bulb requires an initial high voltage starting pulse of 18-25kV to establish the arc.
Warm Up Phase: Once the arc is established the power supply to the bulb is regulated to
2.6A generating a lamp output of 75 watts. This is the period of operation where the xenon
gas begins to brightly illuminate. The warm up phase stabilizes the environment in the bulb
ensuring continual current flow across the electrodes.
Continuous Phase: Once the warm up phase is completed, the system switches to a continuous mode of operation. The supply voltage for the bulb is reduced and the operating
power required for continual bulb illumination is reduced to 35 watts which is less than a
conventional halogen bulb.
FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
To regulate the power supply to the bulbs, additional components are required. The xenon
control modules (1 per light) receive operating power from the lighting control module (LCM
E38/E39 -- LSZ E46) when the headlights are switched on. The xenon control modules provide the regulated power supply to illuminate the bulbs through their phases of operation.
The igniters establish the electric arcs. Integral coils generate the initial high voltage starting pulses from the control module provided starting voltage. Thereafter they provide a
closed circuit for the regulated power output from the control modules.

32
E46 Driver Information

XENON BULB MONITORING
Xenon bulb function is monitored by the Lighting Control Module (LCM E38/E39 -- LSZ
E46). The bulbs are only “hot” monitored. Cold monitoring is not possible since the lighting control module is not in direct control of the xenon bulb. For this reason cold monitoring for low beam headlights is encoded off in the lighting control module for Xenon headlight equipped vehicle.
The lighting control module detects xenon bulb failure via a reduction in current flow to the
xenon control module. When a bulb fails, the xenon control module’s current consumption
drops to 60mA indicating unsuccessful xenon bulb illumination. The lighting control module then posts the appropriate matrix display message or LED illumination in the Check
Control Pictogram display of the E46 and E39 Low Instrument Clusters.

DIAGNOSIS
Xenon control modules are not connected to the diagnostic link. However, the vehicle specific Lighting Control Module (E38/E39 - LCM or E46 - LSZ) does incorporate xenon headlight specific diagnosis up to the xenon control module.

XENON HEADLIGHT TESTING
Warning: Xenon headlight control systems generate high output voltage. Prior to headlight removal or testing observe the vehicle warning labels and be cautious by following
safeguards to prevent accidental injury.
All xenon headlight systems (control
module, igniter and bulb) can be tested with Special Test Adapter (P/N 90
88 6 631 000) in conjunction with the
DIS Measurement System only.
Refer to SI 04 33 96 for detailed
adapter introductory information.
The DIS Measuring System includes all
of the cable connection information
and test procedures in the “Xenon
Preset Measurement”.
The test provides an automatic oscilloscope setup and provides conclusive “defective/not
defective” test results.

HEADLIGHT BEAM THROW CONTROL- LWR
OVERVIEW
LWR automatically adjusts the vertical positioning of the headlights to maintain optimum
headlight beam positioning for maximum driving visibility and to prevent undue glare for
oncoming motorists. The system compensates for vehicle load angle changes (ie: diminishing reserve of gasoline in fuel tank during a long journey, overloaded cargo weight, etc.)
LWR has been available on BMW vehicles in other markets for quite some time. Starting
with the 1999 model year all US market vehicles with Xenon Lights incorporate LWR as
standard equipment. LWR is not available with standard halogen headlights.
LWR monitors the vehicle’s loaded angle via two hall effect sensors mounted to the front
and rear suspension members. When an adjustment is necessary, LWR simultaneously
activates two stepper motors (one in each headlight assembly).
The stepper motors drive a threaded rod that moves the lower edge of the headlight carrier plate forward and backward (depending on driven direction). The upper edge of the
headlight carrier plate is fixed on a pivot. The pivoting movement adjusts the vertical position of the headlight beam.

Note: LWR is identified in the Diagnosis Program as LRA.

LWR COMPONENTS
CONTROL ELECTRONICS
LSZ - E46
The E46 LWR function is integrated into the control electronics of the LSZ. The LSZ monitors the required input signals to provide the LWR function and directly activates the stepper motors in the headlight assemblies. All LWR diagnosis is accessed through the LSZ
control module.
LEVEL SENSORS
LWR monitors two hall effect level sensors to
determine vehicle load angle. The sensors
are mounted to a fixed point on the suspension carriers of the front and rear axles.
A lever is connected to the moving suspension member which changes the sensors output linear voltage signal as the suspension
moves up and down.

HEADLIGHT ADJUSTMENT STEPPER MOTORS
One stepper motor is located inside each
headlight assembly.
The 4 wire stepper motors are controlled
by the LWR control electronics to change
the vertical headlight position.

36
E46 Driver Information

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
The E46 LWR system comes on-line when the ignition switch is turned to KL 15.
The LWR control electronics then cycles the stepper motors through their full range of
motion and stops at a default position.
The control electronics monitors the level sensor input signals to determine the vehicles
load angle and adjusts the beam position accordingly. As the vehicle is driven it continually monitors the level sensor signals and if necessary updates the headlight beam positions
every 25 seconds.
Abrupt fluctuations of the sensor signals are filtered to prevent unnecessary adjustment as
well as monitoring road speed.
HEADLIGHT ALIGNMENT
The procedure for aligning Xenon Headlights with LWR is the same as conventional halogen bulb systems with one additional step. Wait at least 30 seconds for the LWR to cycle
and adjust to it’s calculated position.
LWR DIAGNOSIS
The E46 LSZ incorporates LWR diagnosis program.

MULTI-FUNCTION STEERING WHEEL
The multi-function steering wheel of the E46 corresponds to the MFL introduced on the E38
and carried over to the E39. The wheel contains two key pads on the left and right side of
the air bag that allow activation and control of various driver convince systems.
As with previous MFLs, the left side key pad contains controls for the sound system and
telephone. The right side key pad contains the controls for the cruise control.

The K-Bus is used for data communication between the sound system/telephone controls.
The cruise control has its own data link to the DME control module for cruise control operation.
